    <Description>A desolate world with rich mineral resources, A Place has never been able to feed itself from what it raises from its meager topsoil. When the First Succession War came and commercial JumpShips were requisitioned, the planet's population immediately began to go hungry. Though the Commonwealth Government sent mercy missions, they came too infrequently to stave off mass starvation. Of the million inhabitants at the start of the war, only 100,000 survived until  the war's end. &#xD; The capital and main spaceport of A Place, is Here.</Description>

    <Description>[3014] Duke Anton Marik�s plan to make himself Captain-General had two primary objectives: the capture of Atreus and of Marik. Control of these symbolic worlds would add legitimacy to his claim. As a secondary objective, Anton needed control of as much of the League�s military industrial infrastructure as possible in order to secure the material needed to fuel his rebellion and deny the same to Janos� supporters. Prime targets included Asuncion, Bernardo, Emris IV, Irian, Keystone, Oliver, and Procyon.&#xD; To achieve these objectives, Anton devised a three-pronged operation. The southern thrust (code-named Eagle) would drive towards Atreus. The center thrust (code-named Peregrine) would target Marik. The northern thrust (codenamed Falcon) would sweep up to take key industrial worlds and pick off isolated loyalist commands. &#xD; The spearhead of Taskforce Peregrine consisted of Colonel Nathan Pierce�s Fifth Regulan Hussars and the Second Ducal Guard. Pushing toward the world of Marik, their landing on Abadan was virtually unopposed. The Hussars secured the&#xD;Austin Vale Ordinance plant the day they landed. Dietrich�s Devastators, a lone company of mercenary BattleMechs employed to provide security was no match for a full regiment. With Abadan secured, the rebels began bringing up conventional&#xD;troops and supplies to support the final jump to Marik itself.&#xD; The loyalists chose not to wait for the inevitable. The Stewart Dragons Home Guard had been moved to Marik at the outbreak of the rebellion. Now General Lao Jarreau-Stewart led two of his battalions and a powerful armored brigade in a spoiling raid intended to buy more time to build up Marik�s defenses. Catching the rebels spread out and unprepared for an attack, the Stewart�s Heavy �Mech Battalion pushed the Hussars second battalion out of the Austin Vale Ordinance plant with the assistance of a heavy armor regiment. A second armored regiment held off the Hussars third battalion with the aid of the Stewart�s Light �Mech Battalion.&#xD; Mistaking the loyalist raid for a full-scale counter-invasion, Colonel Pierce chose not to wait for additional intelligence and abandoned Abadan. Losses amounted to only two companies of BattleMechs, but the material that the rebels had been stockpiling was lost as they retreated to Holt.&#xD; [3067] Once the League�s pre-eminent manufacturers of longarms, the merger of Austin Vale Ordnance � based at Kuran on Abadan - and Armstrong Industries in 3044 created a conglomerate capable of holding its own on the international stage. Individually, the companies produced notable but flawed products � the M4T laser rifle and the Derenforth heavy rifle � but by combining their skills and experience, they overcame their weaknesses and now produce solid, reliable equipment. &#xD; The A2 variants of both weapons are the mainstay of the modern FWLM, and Austen-Armstrong has worked closely with the LCCC to develop several new rifles and support weapons. The company�s involvement in small arms remains limited, however, a shortcoming CEO Hanachi hopes to rectify in the near future.</Description>

    <Description>Orbiting a long distance from its sun, Acamar is a world of almost constant winter. The vast mines of precious metals on Acamar's one major continent of Katenga, and various mining operations that also take place within the Illeudian asteroid belt, made it a jewel in the Capellan Confederation's crown for centuries. The Liao government gave Acamar's nobility the lion's share of profits from the planet's gold and silver trading, and so the nobles have always been staunchly pro-Liao. The merchant class, however, chafed under the status quo. Eager to see it changed, they threw their economic weight behind the rebel Pavel Ridzik during the Forth Succession War and helped to found the Tikonov Free Republic. Upon Ridzik's assassination in 3029, the merchant class voted as a body to bring Acamar into the Federated Commonwealth. Under Commonwealth rule, Acamar's merchant class prospered. The nobles, bitterly incensed, no longer had sufficient power to challenge the increasingly powerful middle class. They nursed their grievances along with their Liaoist loyalties, and bided their time.&#xD; When Liao and Marik forces attacked Acamar in 3057, the pro-Liao nobility saw their chance. Acting in concert with Capellan agents and their own private armies, Acamar's nobles overwhelmed the planetary garrison in a series of swift attacks. To celebrate their stunning victory, the victorious Liao loyalists forced the captured garrison troops out into Acamar's brutal winter with scant clothing and supplies. Most of the soldiers died; the few who survived found shelter were rescued a few days later by Patrick Gladden, the owner of a large silver mine.&#xD; Enraged at the thought of Acamar falling back under Capellan sway, Gladden persuaded several of his colleagues to form the Acamar Merchants Freedom Guild. In their first act, Guild members pooled their resources to hire a mercenary unit from Outreach to take back the planet. The Tiger Sharks, a combined-arms battalion, hit the ground running, destroying numerous �mechs and vehicles and liberating two major cities in their initial engagements with the Liao forces. After being badly mauled during a major Liao counterattack, however, the Tiger Sharks attempted an assault on Acamar�s capital of Kalskag. Confident of Kalskag�s defenses, the Liao government ordered the bulk of its troops to assault the HQ of the Acamar Merchants Freedom Guild in the city of Flat.&#xD; The Tiger Sharks stormed into Kalskag, overrunning the few remaining government troops. They leveled the capitol building and killed several prominent nobles inside. In Flat, government tanks rolled over much of the city center, and the leaders of the AMFG fled before the onslaught. With their employers vanished into hiding or offworld, the Tiger Sharks sought passage off Acamar, returning to Outreach to rebuild and seek a new contract.&#xD; No centralized government currently exists on Acamar. Most towns have become independent city-states with their own laws, many run by former members of the AMFG and others by surviving Liaoist nobles. Acamar's people have largely ceased fighting and returned to mining, selling the ore to those traders brave enough to travel through the Chaos March. A remnant of the Acamar Merchants Freedom Guild, determined to see the planet under the FedCom banner, has set up offices on Outreach, where they hope to raise enough funds to hire more troops to retake their world.</Description>

    <Description>Founded in 3035, the Accrington FTM is one of the oldest regional militias in the Lyran Alliance, originally intended to bolster defenses against the Draconis combine. The unit faced its first test in late 3036 when, a month after spearheading the liberation of Aubison, the Fifth Amphigean LAG raided Accrington. Though they outnumbered the raiders, the heavy Steiner �Mechs faired badly against the light �Mechs of the LAG. They were outmaneuvered and humiliated by the experienced Combine warriors, though neither force sustained any major losses. The humiliating defeat did not play well in Skye, earning scorn for the concept of regional militias.</Description>

    <Description>First settled by the Terran Hegemony, Achernar is a self-sufficient world with a varied terrain and climate. The original rulers of the planet, the Achernar family, were known Davion sympathizers. Before the First Star League, they allowed the Federated Suns to stage offensives from Achernar against worlds that would later form the Capellan Confederation. The Achernars later established the Achernar BattleMechs company, which manufactured the Dervish BattleMech for the First Star League. &#xD; During the fall of the First Star League, the Achernar family sought refuge in the Federated Suns. House Davion agreed to grant the family royal titles if they would relocate Achernar BattleMechs to the Davion capital of New Avalon. Achernar BattleMechs would go on to manufacture the unique Enforcer BattleMech for House Davion. House Liao claimed Achernar after the fall of the First Star League. During the Fourth Succession War, House Davion captured Achernar and restored the Achernar family to its home world for the first time in centuries. Although Achernar BattleMechs stayed on New Avalon, the family established Achernar IndustrialMechs on Achernar during the Second Star League. &#xD; The three continents of Achernar are Agnetenar, Eridanus, and Zaurak; the capital of River's End is located on Eridanus.</Description>

The city of Illampu is home to the headquarters of Acrux Agricultural Industries. After its president absconded with most of the company's cash and assets in 3019, Acrux Agricultural underwent a major reorganization. Under new president Carma Rosado, the future of the firm seems good. It has already posted impressive first-year earnings and has made many contacts and prospective clients, both in the Commonwealth and the Free Worlds League.&#xD; [3056] Acrux has recently come under attack from a terrorist organization calling itself the Farmers Liberation Resistance Movement (FLRM). The FLRM claims that Acrux is destroying their livelihood by crowding or taking over their land. The FLRM has torched many of Acrux's fields on Valloire, creating a massive loss of profit for the agricultural giant.</Description>

    <Description>Large, with four small moons and an atmosphere most visitors liken to breathing soup, Addicks is nonetheless a pleasant and temperate world.&#xD; One of the "Golden Ten" universities of the Star League, the university of Addicks was devoted to training teachers and professors. To provide a realistic training environment, Addicks ran five other schools in which teacher trainees could develop their skills with real students. Nothing remains today.&#xD; [3025] When the Star League fell, the wealthy Johnstons of the Federated Suns purchased the Tauken Weapons System manufacturing facility on Addicks, despite the fact that the planet would most surely become a battlefield once the fighting started. When the war began, the Johnstons had to sit on their hands and watch as forces from the Federated Suns, the Draconis Combine, and the Capellan Confederation made their bids for the planet.&#xD; By the time the Federated Suns finally secured the world, over half the factories had been destroyed. The only factories that had managed to survive were those manufacturing trooper-portable laser and particle weapons and the one producing the Goblin medium tank. Fortunately for the Johnston family, the Goblin's ability to carry a squad of infantry make it a favorite of AFFS mechanized regiments. There are rumors that Johnston Industries is considering opening a new facility on New Syrtis.&#xD; Headquartered on Addicks, Three Houses is a large entertainment agency specializing in music groups and live acts. The firm is one of the few Davion agencies that regularly sends acts into the Draconis Combine and the Capellan Confederation.&#xD; Because live entertainment is not on the list of items forbidden by the Economic War Powers Act, the Three Houses entertainment troupes move back and forth into enemy realms. Though all our evidence indicates that Three Houses is actually gathering information for both the Department of Military Intelligence and the M17-MIIO, both agencies keep the firm under heavy surveillance to prevent becoming the victims of a double-cross. At the moment, Three Houses has two equally popular groups under contract. One is the Kyotan Native Instrument Band and the other is the Jameson Troubadours, both groups whose music appeals to the people of all three realms.</Description>

In Gorraine�s absence, her granddaughter Kim was confirmed as interim Magestrix. Three years later, Kim took the title officially when the wreckage of Gorraine�s airship was discovered. Though the cause of the crash remains a mystery, the date of her disappearance, June 17th, is a solemn legal holiday on Canopus. The anniversary is known as Gorraine Remembrance Day.</Description>

    <Description>[3059] The most independent-minded of the League's military schools, the Aitutaki Academy has provided the Principality of Regulus with officers and troops for the past 650 years. Founded by order of Hered Selaj in 2414, the academy has been inextricably entwined with the fortunes of the principality ever since. Despite the best efforts of the LCCC, this academy remains a bastion of anti-Marik sentiment. Rumors suggest that a large number of each year's new cadets are actually SAFE operatives assigned to keep an eye on instructors and pupils.&#xD; Since Thomas Marik assumed the Captain-Generalcy, the Quartermaster General has managed to consistently thwart the academy's attempts to maintain a Regulan-only admissions policy. In the past three years the academy has apparently accepted the LCCC's admissions guidelines, choosing to control who graduates by other measures.&#xD; Aitutaki imposes a strict physical-fitness regime on its students, with calisthenics and various sports a part of daily life. Field craft � particularly navigation, hunting and survival � is an important element of the standard first year of training.&#xD; The academy covers all aspects of ground warfare, but specializes in training MechWarriors and armor crews. For much of the Succession Wars the academy maintained an aerospace training program, but this branch of the school was disbanded following a series of fatal training accidents in 2996. Aitutaki also maintains a strong technical tradition, particularly in field maintenance techniques, and it consistently produces some of the best technicians in the League. The LCCC has attempted to force the academy�s technical training staff to relocate to remove this vital part of the military education system from Regulan control, but has thus far met with little success.&#xD; Aitutaki maintains the ancient military tradition of hazing - inflicting pseudo-torture on new entrants - and has used sanctioned abuse to persuade "undesirables" to leave the academy within the first semester. The Captain-General and the LCCC have ordered the school's administration to end this practice and punish those who implement hazing, but the Academy's commandant has denied responsibility for any such incidents.&#xD; Sixty MechWarriors a year graduate from the Aitutaki Academy, along with almost ten-times that number in other military specialties. The LCCC deliberately assigns most of these graduates away from the Regulan Hussars regiments, but this practice does little to moderate academy graduate�s pro-Regulus, anti-Marik views.</Description>

The BattleMech facility was a joint venture by Luthien Armor Works and Alshain Weapons.  Damaged in 3010, the plant is only recently back in production.

Conditions were so favorable that the original settlers did not even bother to bring along extra food supplies; they thought that the native wildlife would feed them.  Unfortunately, what the settlers did bring were diseases that decimated many of the native lifeforms before cures and treatments could be found.  Then, like a counterattack, a disease native to the planet attacked the settlers who had become weak from malnutrition.  When the crisis finally ended, most of the native lifeforms were extinct and over half the settlers were dead.  This disaster led the Commonwealth government to issue strict quarantine and settlement procedures that are still in effect.&#xD; Today, Alarion is a center of heavy industry.  It also possesses the only orbiting shipyards in the Commonwealth, the Port Sydney Naval Shipyards, which are capable of refitting and repairing JumpShips.  As most of the world's natural resources are being exploited, there are very few unsettled areas among its two continents and many islands.  The capital city is Craiova.&#xD; Many legends have grown up around General Kerensky and the exodus of the Regular Army. One such myth concerns Jessica LeQue, wife of one of Kerensky's aides. Beautiful, lithe, and golden-haired, she was a native of the Alarion. Born to a noble family, Jessica had been raised to love her native planet deeply. Later, she felt the same deep connection to the handsome Major Winsome, aide to General Kerensky. &#xD; When the exodus orders came, Jessica was torn between love for her land and love for her husband. It was not until an hour before the last transport was about to leave Alarion for the rendezvous at New Samarkand, that she finally made her decision. Jessica Winsome arrived perhaps a moment too late at the spaceport, for just then, the last transport arched into the night sky, leaving her behind. From there, the distraught woman wandered into the nearby forest, where several weeks later she was found dead.&#xD; On Alarion, there is a native tree that is tall, slim, and crowned with golden leaves. At night, the fronds of the tree reach up and unfurl to collect the silvery moonlight. Ever since Jessica Winsome's death, these have been known as Jessica Trees, the reaching of their golden fronds like Jessica's hopeless gesture as the night sky took away her husband forever.&#xD; [3062] The Alarion Naval Academy is the newest school for LAAF personnel and has yet to graduate its first class. The Alliance's efforts to build a WarShip fleet, as well as to crew the DropShips and JumpShips inherited from the Federated Commonwealth with loyal personnel overtaxed a military education system not geared to supporting a combatant navy. Additionally, with the exception of the Nagelring, the existing naval academies on Thorin and Pandora were judged at risk from foreign forces. These two circumstances prompted Archon Katherine Steiner to order the establishment of a new naval academy on Alarion, using equipment and personnel from the older schools. Construction began in late 3058, and the first cadets began their studies in May 3060, with the first graduates expected early next year.</Description>

    <Description>The sleepy agro-world of Albalii was settled initially by Arabic colonists shortly after the first galactic wave of human expansion. Almost half of the planet's surface is taken up by three major landmasses-Omar in the southern hemisphere and Sadig and Euphrates in the north-but these continents have been carved into giant plateaus by the unusually strong currents of the surrounding oceans. With more than 70 percent of the coastline consisting of steep, rocky cliffs, and few inland lakes and rivers, Albalii's relatively flat inland regions proved a poor candidate for agricultural industry. Cities sprang up along the few beachfront areas and readily accessible rivers, while many of the desert plains were exploited for their modest mineral wealth. &#xD; In the days of the Star League, the planetary government, hoping to expand the arable frontiers on Albalii, embarked on an ambitious plan to transfer large quantities of ocean water to prepared lake areas inland. Through advanced water purification technologies, these lakes would be used for drinking water and crop irrigation. Though local ecologists were outraged, the Albalii government considered the alternative - hiring ice ships to bring in offworld ice - far too risky and expensive. DropShips spent ten years moving trillions of gallons of ocean water inland, creating massive, man-made lakes and seas like the Great Omar Reservoir and the Tigris Sea on Euphrates. The result expanded Albalii's arable lands a thousandfold. &#xD; Today, these new inland seas are the sites of many of this world's cities, including the large spaceport of Giza, along the northern coast of the Galilee Basin on Sadig, and the resort city of Saladan on the Great Omar Reservoir. Albalii's capital and first colonial settlement, Borqa, is on the eastern coast of Sadig, at the mouth of the Naball River.</Description>

    <Description>Although Albiero has a low population and almost no industry, it is the most prosperous planet in its prefecture (the others are even more desolate).  Considered a wasteland of dead planets, the Albiero Prefecture contains mostly worlds that once were rich in minerals and metals, but have long since been mined out and deserted.  In addition, Brocchi's star cluster, a group of several stars and planets, is a favorite hiding place for pirates and renegades, and they have wreaked havoc on the population remaining here.&#xD; Albiero itself once contained a vast wealth of iron and copper, which prompted the Holden Mining corporation to dispatch settlers to this planet in 2735.  In fact, the planet's wealth led the corporation to move its headquarters to this planet.  Tunnel drivers made huge networks of tunnels under the planet's surface.  From Albiero, other mining concerns struck out for nearby worlds to mine their wealth.&#xD; After the fall of the Star League, the mining equipment on Albiero fell into disrepair, and there was no one who knew how to fix it.  The mining companies soon went bankrupt, and Albiero and the other planets in this prefecture became little more than ghost planets.  Because the area soon lost prestige due to the lost income, the prefecture gradually became smaller.  In 2957, the Pesht Military District absorbed a large chunk of the prefecture (including the former prefecture capital of Wolcott), and the Coordinator named Albiero as the new capital.&#xD; Since then, Albiero has become an ideal training ground for soldiers.  There are few civilians left on the planet, and the soldiers can train in the planet's vast network of tunnels.  Unfortunately, the Pesht Prefecture still overshadows this prefecture, and few soldiers ever get to see these training facilities.&#xD; The head offices of the giant Matabushi Incorporated, are based in Corant City on Albiero. Matabushi's position proves the adage that "the giant grows unchecked." It has survived wars and economic crises in its position as the most prosperous and technologically advanced company in Kurita space. It now has the government seal of approval, allowing it first bid on any contracts and also giving it first civilian access to any new technology captured.&#xD; [3050] Clan Smoke Jaguar's First Jaguar Guards came to Albiero in July 3050. The defending Eighth Albiero Militia attacked the Jaguar's immediately after they landed, and pushed them back to Dartson Ridge. At the ridgeline, the Eighth's armored battalion launched a deadly rain of artillery, trapping the Jaguars until Trinary Striker broke out in a fierce assault and charged toward the artillery. While the Striker Trinary demolished the artillery units, Trinary Command and Alpha Elemental Star located the defender's supply caches. A successful ambush at the principal cache destroyed the militia regiment's command company; shortly afterward, all resistance collapsed save for a few companies that escaped into the hills. The escapees continue to harass the Smoke Jaguar occupying forces with hit-and-run guerrilla raids.&#xD; [3059] During the Forth and final wave of Operation Bulldog, the Smoke Jaguar defenders on most of their remaining OZ worlds only fought long enough to satisfy their honor. On Albiero, the Eleventh Jaguar Regulars fought to the death against the combined might of the Second Dieron Regulars, Warrior House Dai Da Chi, First Wolf Strike Cluster, and the Crater Cobras. House Dai Da Chi warriors did manage to capture a Jaguar supply base full of supplies and technicians. Though all the on-planet SLDF forces split the supplies between them as per regulations, the technician prisoners elected to become bondsmen to the Dai Da Chi.</Description>

    <Description>A warm world blasted by a harsh, bright yellow subdwarf star, Alchiba's three southern-most continents � Frome, Nakkara, and Priez � are largely dominated by deserts and barren mountains, thanks to a lack of inland water sources. Scrub brush and small oases fed by underground water sources, however, have sustained limited mining and ore-refining industries in various grades of common and industrial metals. The northern polar continent of Havenri and its surrounding island chains, however, have been blessed with rich soils and a temperate climate that have proven remarkably well suited for agriculture. &#xD; The cause for this contrast is, of course, the planet's axial tilt, which is well synchronized with its rotation and orbit so that the northern hemisphere receives less direct sunlight than the southern and equatorial reaches. The settlers on Alchiba thus developed much of Havenri for habitation and agriculture, reserving the southern lands for industrial expansion. &#xD; During the Star League era, Alchiba was jointly administered by the Lyran Commonwealth and the Terran Hegemony, during which time it served both states as a trading post. Fortunately, its relative lack of heavy military industries led Amaris' troops to largely ignore this world during the crisis that destroyed the League and ultimately left Alchiba in Lyran hands. &#xD; The Succession Wars likewise overlooked Alchiba, save for the odd raid launched by Houses Marik or Kurita. As a result, Alchiba continues to play the role of the local interstellar breadbasket, with agricultural and light machine products forming the core of a modest but robust economy. Much of this trade flows through the planetary capital and port city of Fairweather, on the Havenri continent.</Description>

    <Description>Alcor is a rare world in that it actually orbits a slightly variable star and yet has been blessed with an atmosphere and environment capable of supporting life. The planet's remote orbit, however, appears to somewhat mitigate the gravitational stresses caused during the infrequent shifts of its star's outer surface. Some scientists believe these stresses, still felt in the form of frequent earthquakes and a noticeable spike or drop in overall temperatures, may have played a role in speeding along the evolution of local life-forms, which run the gamut from single-celled bacteria that thrive near polar geysers, to the goldfish-sized Alcoran swimmers which populate the planet's equatorial zones. &#xD; The tectonic stresses created by the Alcoran star have also contributed to a number of volcanoes that line the geologically young mountain chains on both main continents, Galvinia and Fuchisa. Since the early colonists first settled this world, much of the planet�s mining industry has been focused in these volcanic regions, where the abundant metals churned from the planet's active core are easier to reach. Unfortunately, however, much of the arable land on Alchiba is exceedingly poor in nutrients, forcing the locals to rely on trade with their neighboring systems for vital agricultural products. &#xD; This lack has made Alcor the hub of local trade routes throughout its history, but a poor staging world throughout the Succession Wars, though it has done little to prevent the raids and invasions that characterized that same period of history. The capital of Alcor, Ursamajorisaeti, is located on Galvina, and is also home to the planet's largest spaceport.</Description>

    <Description>[3039] Neither Colonel Archibald McCarron nor his regimental commanders found much comfort in the post-Fourth Succession War era. The Chancellor was becoming more and more paranoid. Every report of her capricious nature and the brutality visited upon the Capellan people by her minions both rankled and frightened them. While first Maximilian and now Romano Liao had left them mostly to their own devices, they knew that would not last forever. They welcomed any hope of battle, for they knew that would at least keep the Chancellor and her evil eye from targeting them as she had struck out at so many of her other military leaders.&#xD; Archie McCarron was surprised when three CCAF senior colonels visited him on Menke in May of 3039, and all but stunned when they suggested he undertake an operation of such magnitude into the Federated Suns. But as he looked over the intelligence reports that they had brought with them, McCarron was quickly won over. This was by no means a full-fledged invasion, however; the CCAF was still far too weak to even consider such a possibility. &#xD; In fact, more than anything, this was designed to be more of a morale-building exercise. Having just recently driven the Canopians from their nation, the CCAF�s victory was tempered by the fact that it took five years of military action to do so. What the CCAF needed was a true victory, one that was unmistakable and could proclaim to the entire Human Sphere that the Confederation was still a military power, and who better to target than the mighty Federated Suns.&#xD; Alcyone was the very first target of Archie McCarron�s incursion into the Federated Suns in July 3039. It was also one of the most questionable from a strategic standpoint, as the world was not only the headquarters of the Alcyone PDZ but also the homeworld of the Alcyone Capellan March Militia. If Archie was trying to embark on a military expedition that he hoped to keep �below the radar� as long as possible, Alcyone was just about the worst world to pick. After all, it had responsibility for a portion of the Capellan border and was undoubtedly watching very closely for any sign of Capellan military activity.&#xD; But Archie McCarron wasn�t interested in keeping his attacks a secret. He wanted the entire AFFS to know what his mercenary regiments were able to do. Further, he struck Alcyone specifically because it was home to a march militia; there were undoubtedly large military warehouses full of materiel and supplies that the Big Mac and the CCAF could use. And so McCarron assigned Colonel Marcus Barton and his Second MAC to the strike.&#xD; Barton surprised the CMM with his appearance and maintained the initiative throughout his week on the world. Of course, it also helped that he didn�t directly attack the CMM and instead focused his efforts on striking what logistical and industrial targets he could find. Further, he made a point to break off from any engagement where he did not field the overwhelming advantage in manpower and firepower. During that week, however, Barton�s mercenaries managed to steal more than a thousand tons of supplies from an outlying planetary militia armory. They also severely damaged the Alcyone Interstellar Spaceport and Dockyards, destroying countless cargo containers � and hundreds of millions of C-Bills worth of food and civilian industrial products � in the process. &#xD; The regiment lifted off the world just hours after that attack on the spaceport, bound ultimately for Kathil. By then, reports of similar attacks on Monhegan and Bethel had already reached PDZ commander General Dain Voss on Alcyone. He immediately dispatched almost half of the CMM to track down the Big Mac, and likewise ordered the First Kittery Borderers to do the same. Neither unit, however, managed to intercept any MAC regiments until Kathil.</Description>

    <Description>Until Kerensky led his Exodus from the Inner Sphere, the small world of Alfirk claimed the distinction of being the human colony most distant from Terra - a dubious distinction, as the existence of Alfirk was completely unknown. The colonist who would establish Alfirk left Terra like so many others in the twenty-second century, to start a new life with people of like goals and dreams. Colonel William Alfirk III, a retired Terran Alliance tank commander whose survivalist attitude and considerable personal fortune attracted a strong crop of colonists from the military sector, led the group. After making five coreward jumps, the sixth resulted in a minor drive malfunction that damaged their sensors. Luckily they found themselves stranded in a system featuring a small world suitable for colonization. They named the settlement they built there Alfirk, in honor of their esteemed leader.&#xD; The Alfirk colony prospered with no support or contact from the Alliance. This suited the colonists just fine, and they were fortunate enough to require no outside water or other supplies. This isolation might have lasted forever if not for a planetwide plague that killed nearly half the population in 2963. Desperate for a cure, a small team of scientists decided to repair their ancient JumpShip and head for Terra. Once the ship�s instruments came online, the scientists made a shocking discovery; Alfirk was not six jumps from Terra, as the colonists had always believed. The drive malfunction that burned out the sensors was actually a serious misjump that took them hundreds of light-years off course. After some hurried astronomical calculations, the scientists discovered that Alfirk was in fact 700 light-years from Terra.&#xD; A series of government debates resulted in the decision to send the JumpShip back toward Terra to try and establish contact with the Alliance. The plague seemed to claiming fewer victims each day, but medical assistance was still vital to the colony�s survival. Fortunately, the JumpShip encountered an Explorer Corps vessel before reaching the territories of the Draconis Combine. ComStar offered the Alfirk colonists the medicine they needed to end the plague, plus many technological advances, including improved armaments. ComStar agents periodically return to Alfirk to monitor the colony�s progress, keeping their existence a secret from the Inner Sphere.</Description>

    <Description>Algedi is a barren world beneath a sun so large that it takes up a full third of the sky during the day. Because the sun allows no true night, people not  accustomed to the planet seem to suffer from broken biological clocks. Efficiency on this world is very poor; only the Alegedian Azami, long-settled on this arid world, seem to have adjusted. When they leave Algedi, however, they are terrified of the dark.&#xD; The Azami of Algedi are very independent, which has often led to clashes between their ways and those of the Combine. They own half of the planet, but non-Azami are not allowed to enter their "Desert Paradise." The ISF presence here is fairly high but inconspicuous.&#xD; Descended from Terran African's, the Azami people first settled Algedi, and nearby worlds, in the early days of the 25th century. Within a century though, in the spring of 2497, the Von Rohrs Coordinators sent out military expeditions to break the Azami and integrate them into Kurita society and ideology. Three regiments of Kurita BattleMechs landed on Algedi, but Terran viruses that lay latent in the Azami bloodstreams eventually wiped out the Draconis invaders. Though this problem could have been overcome easily in subsequent campaigns, those campaigns never took place, because the Von Rohrs line was interrupted and exterminated by the McAllister Rebellion on Luthien.&#xD; The Azami had a realistic appreciation of their position. In 2516, an Azami delegation arrived on Luthien. In return for formal autonomy, they agreed to allow Kurita exploitation of their mineral resources. They also agreed to act as border units for the Draconis military, and to serve when required as cross-border raiders, with their Kurita-provided light and medium 'Mechs traveling in Kurita JumpShips and DropShips. These became the famous Arkab Legions.&#xD; The question of religion and ideology proved more difficult to resolve. In the end, the Azami decided that the Dictum Honorium was not really so foreign to their own strict desert codes. Citing the Islamic principle of taqiyya, or caution, which allowed a Shi'ite to pass himself off as a mainline Sunni Moslem if it meant saving his life, the Azami agreed to adopt the Dictum as their ideology if the Kurita agreed not to inquire too closely into their faithfulness to it. After Hehiro Kurita assumed the Coordinatorship from his mother Siriwan, the male supremacist Azami found it convenient, if not to replace their Imam as 'Zaman messiah with the Kurita Coordinator, at least to blur the lines when dealing with Draconis emissaries.&#xD; Though there has been much talk about moving the prefecture capital to a planet where the bureaucracy can function effectively, nothing comes of it. Despite the most modern equipment, paperwork in this prefecture is in a perpetual snarl.&#xD; Imported life forms adapted to desert life are flourishing on the planet. Asketen Sand Walkers and Terran Burros are commonly seen grazing on tough grasses and cacti. Some minor deposits of gold have been discovered on the planet, but not enough to warrant exploitation.</Description>

The largest continent, Shalom, contains the planetary capital of Algol City. It is here that the planet�s food exports are brought for shipment off world through its large spaceport. &#xD; Algol City was founded on the coast due to the abundance of fish found in the surrounding waters. Exploration of the remaining continent of Durant revealed that the soil was extremely rich, allowing production of a wide range of agricultural products. The planet immediately began to grow and flourish. The largest city, Kollasa, is home to the planet�s massive food-processing plants. Processed foods are shipped to Algol City on massive barges on the Montrose River. On Durant, the city of Schan was the planet�s largest source of potassium and other important chemicals used in the production of munitions. &#xD; During the Fourth succession War, Count Wayne Hargrove-Sung had negotiated the peaceful surrender of the 1st Ariana Fusiliers.

The solar radiation, however, blasted all five of these worlds with incredible heat, rendering all worlds but one completely uninhabitable.&#xD; The farthest planet, a ringed world which somehow managed to form shallow polar oceans, an atmosphere with sufficient ozone protection, and even some primitive plant-life, thus became a colony site for people eager to escape the tyranny of Terran government in mankind's first exodus into space. Despite higher than average concentrations of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of methane, Algorab drew a remarkable number of colonists eager to exploit this world for its metallic and natural gas deposits.&#xD;The planet's interior - well between the polar oceans of Niriama in the north and Vanishing Sea in the south - became populated by a smattering of shielded, climate-controlled mining and refining colonies, linked to the more hospitable shoreline settlements by a system of maglev rail lines and airship cruisers. The lands in between, largely barren wastes of rock and sand, is inhabited by only the hardiest of settlers from Terra's central African and Middle Eastern regions. The promise of profit in the fuel and mining industries drew many more people to Algorab over the decades, even though this world lay uncommonly far from its jump point and lacked sufficient arable land to support itself without reliance on freeze-dried foods from off-world.&#xD; These same factors, however, made Algorab a difficult target for raids throughout the Succession Wars, and only a few assaults were launched against this planet.

Specializing in computer and electronic-related sciences.  Algot was one of the most populous worlds of the region at the beginning of the 29th century.  Both population and technologies have declined markedly since.  This is partially due to a mysterious plague that hit in 2822, and disappeared just as mysteriously the following year.  The main factor in the decline of population was the heavy emigration and the lack of immigration after Algot gained its reputation for being bad for one's health.  For the past two centuries, however, the health of the general population has been exceptionally good.  Native Algotians do not let on that they have the third-longest life expectancy in Davion space because they fear that new waves of immigration would spoil the quality of rivers, mountain ranges, and resorts that make the planet one of the Inner Sphere's more pleasant homeworlds or places to visit.</Description>

    <Description>Another unlikely candidate for colonization, Alhena was initially settled as little more than a scientific outpost during mankind's earliest ventures into space, exploring the potential for life under even the harshest environments. Orbiting the outer sun of a binary star system whose primary and secondary suns vary between nine and twelve Terran standard astronomical units in distance, this world has developed a peculiar orbit as a result of the interacting pull of both suns, creating a pattern where long, harsh winters follow short, but pleasant, summers. &#xD; Despite this inhospitable environment and the relative lack of free water on the planet's surface, small settlements eventually rose all over the northern hemisphere, particularly along the shores of the polar Alhennian Ocean. Lacking in major resources, this world was largely overlooked throughout the Age of War and the Star League era, even though it relied heavily on off-world trade � particularly in agricultural machinery and products � in order to sustain its population. &#xD; Through the Succession Wars, however, its position as a Free Worlds League border world led to several raids by nearby House Steiner, leaving the surface scarred and battered, further undermining the people's ability to raise enough food for self-sufficiency. &#xD; Alhena's capital city and primary spaceport, Focci's Point, is located near the eastern shores of the Alhennian Ocean.</Description>

    <Description>The colonists who first came to Alioth were impressed almost immediately by the thick, hyper-oxygenated atmosphere and unusual warmth for a planet that orbits so far out from its parent star. Only slightly more intriguing was the abundance of native flora for such a geologically young world, a factor attributed to bursts of solar radiation that appear to pulse from the sun every few hundred years or so.&#xD; In the centuries since colonizing Alioth, the natives have learned to shield their structures against the harmful bursts of solar radiation created by this unusually active sun, which have been known to completely disrupt communications and produce worldwide outbreaks of cancer cases every few generations. Local astronomers have also long since learned how to read the telltale signs of new bursts of activity, in response to which the planet itself goes into a kind of global shutdown, as if waiting out a worldwide storm.&#xD; Yet, despite its drawbacks, life on Alioth has been remarkably pleasant since its first settlements appeared in mankind�s early exodus, thanks to fertile soils and mild weather cycles that made it possible for a variety of Terran and Terran-hybrid food crops to flourish and support a booming agricultural industry. In addition, the island chains off the coasts of Uvania, the planet�s large northern continent, with their semitropical landscapes of wildly varied native flora, and striking mountain landscapes, were perfect for establishing exciting getaways for the idle rich, creating a robust tourist trade.&#xD; During the Terran Hegemony era, Alioth became a breadbasket and holiday retreat for citizens across the Hegemony, and business truly boomed in the Star League era, when the world opened up to foreign travelers as well. Unfortunately, the Amaris Crisis led to this world�s fall from grace. Claimed by House Steiner after the fall of the League, Alioth became another Free Worlds/Lyran border planet, a strategic point during raids and campaigns waged between Steiner and Marik forces for the centuries to come. &#xD; Through the Succession Wars, Alioth�s farmlands became scarred battlegrounds and its resorts declined as garrison troops and invading soldiers alike consumed the local resources like locusts. The capital of Alioth, Warrinzer, is located on the northeastern coast of Uvania, fifty kilometers north of the primary port city of Staniskil.</Description>

This medium-sized world, far removed from its local jump point � though local guides can provide experienced navigators with fool-proof maps of nonstandard points for a faster trip � was discovered during mankind's first steps into space. &#xD; Early colonial efforts, however, were slow to develop, thanks to the planet's climate, and the four-month in-system journey to and from its surface. The extremely long revolution cycle, one planetary year passing for every fifty-one Terran years, and the resulting extreme periods between "dry" and "wet" seasons, further discouraged agricultural potential, another mark against colonization. &#xD; In fact, were it not for the twenty-fourth-century discovery of a host of commercially valuable chemicals and ores, just below its rocky, sandy surface, the Alkaid system would likely have become little more than a place to park a recharge station. Under the auspices of the Federation of Skye, however, the development of its chemical industry and a series of in-system buoys to guide traffic to and from the planet helped bring about the first real, permanent settlements. &#xD; The first of these settlements (and the largest to date), Moravska Ostrava, was established on the banks of Khalek�s Novaya Minsk River delta, and is home today of Toloy-Daelun Chemicals, which controls over twenty-three chemical extraction, processing, and distribution plants on Alkaid alone. However, while most business on Alkaid passes through Moravska Ostrava, the planetary capital, Verstigrad, is located almost 500 kilometers inland, on the banks of Lake Tatyanna.</Description>

    <Description>Alkalurops is a warm and oppressive world, plagued by frequent hurricanes and tornadoes that are the result of a thick atmosphere, cursed further by greenhouse gases that amplify the heat of its white A-class sun. These conditions have prevented the evolution of any form of surface animal life, though native fish do thrive in the deeper parts of the planet's two large oceans. &#xD; Because of its inhospitable nature, colonization and development of Alkalurops proceeded slowly. Most settlements, founded on the northernmost continent of Vandika, were established close to pockets of natural gas and common metal veins, pumped and mined for export sale. To protect against the harsh weather and attain a degree of comfortable living, most of these early colonies were dug into the mountains and hills, and every structure was pressurized and outfitted with advanced air filters to make the interior air breathable.&#xD; Allabad, the planetary capital, was originally one such colony, nestled into the base of the north-south-running Bagadell Mountain Chain, and much of the city today still retains the look of a modernized Pueblo Indian village. Mainly due to these living conditions, the inhabitants of Alkalurops developed a curiously insular - almost xenophobic - culture, intensely distrustful of off-worlders.&#xD; Though more accepting overall of other citizens in the Lyran realm - particularly those from the Isle of Skye - Alkalurops's people showed little patience or hospitality to visitors from the Terran Hegemony. Even during the Star League era, when extra revenue resulting from trade with Nusakan, a key world in the Hegemony's computer industry, brought an influx of traders and entrepreneurs here, the natives of this world remained cold and aloof.&#xD; During the Amaris crisis, the Usurper's troops struck at Alkalurops despite its being outside Hegemony borders, hoping to deny any liberation force the use of the planet as a staging area to reclaim Nusakan. Instead, native resistance repelled Amaris's troops, a pattern repeated whenever raiders and invading neighbors struck the world during the Succession Wars. With few resources worth fighting over and an inhospitable climate, however, such raids were rare.</Description>

    <Description>Despite orbiting a relatively cool Class K0 giant, Alnasi presently has a higher mean temperature than Terra, and has been getting ever warmer for the past thousand years or so. The reason for this is an imbalance in the planet�s iron core, created due to the complex gravitational attractions of the two gas giant worlds that formed at unusually close orbital distances to the planet. While the existence of these giants and their gravitational effects did not appear to stunt Alsani�s development into a life-bearing � if somewhat young � planet, their effect has created a world that maintains a rather eccentric orbit. &#xD; Alnasi orbits its parent sun (formerly known as Gamma 2-Sagittarius) with an orbital path that shifts radically when the pull of the outer giant outweighs that of the inner giant, an event that occurs once every 1,773 years. Coupled with a wobble that creates a complex seasonal cycle to begin with, this has created a world where animal life has had great difficulty evolving due to long, abruptly recurring ice ages interspersed with periods of flooding, drought, and peculiar storms. When settled initially, Alnasi was hospitable, but on the cool side, with receding polar caps and great expanses of thick and hardy woodlands, and rocky mountains dotting its landscape. Today, centuries later, the planet's average temperature has increased by over fifteen degrees, and deserts have overrun much of the inland woods. &#xD; Though scientists have predicted the trend will continue until the planet becomes virtually uninhabitable for a time, the people of Alnasi never felt rushed to take any precautions in anticipation of such an eventuality. Instead, the corporations drawn to Alnasi for its ample veins of common metal alloys and natural gas deposits built a series of cities and industrial complexes across all four of the world's continents. Together with the cities maintained by the descendents of the original colonists, all construction and development is looking to the immediate future.&#xD; The spaceport capital city of Gantarius, is located on the northern continent of Lantilles. Alnasi�s other three continents, Hecateas, Insarroples, and Rowenopia, are located in the middle southern latitudes, connected to Lantilles primarily by ocean-going and transcontinental air traffic.</Description>

On the surface, the world's lands are equally plain, mostly consisting of rolling hills, the odd rocky mountain peak, and grassy plains. &#xD; Though the climate varies from artic tundra to tropical equatorial reaches, on close inspection nothing about Alphecca stands out from the hundreds of swirling worlds that mankind calls home. Lacking in significant, readily accessible natural resources, Alphecca proved suitable only for settlement as a quiet farming world, its primary exports being native grains and meat from the gillarg, a large, relatively dumb amphibian that many locals describe as "a cross between a cow and a cowardly, toothless alligator."&#xD; The people of Alphecca gradually became inured to their sustenance-level existence, to the point where visitors often scoffed at their laid-back attitude toward even the most divisive political and religious matters. For centuries, the world's mediocrity and the lethargy of its inhabitants were its shield. Regarded as little more than a staging area for raids, or a quiet place for R&amp;R, only a few odd roving bandits paid this world a visit after its first colonization, and it only changed hands between the Lyran Commonwealth and the Draconis Combine twice in its history. Alphecca was thus spared the worst of the Succession Wars and the FedCom Civil War.&#xD; Alphecca's capital city, Galanette Rainbow, is located on the northernmost island continent of Gataka. The other northern continent, Rubekka, is home to the planet's largest seaport city, Fescher's Dock.

    <Description>Alrakis, a large, warm planet rich in metals, both in its rocky mountain ranges and on the barren surfaces of its three largest moons, has been an industrial prize for both the Lyran and Draconis states since the earliest days of the Great Houses. The rich mineral ores drew more mining, manufacturing, and shipping concerns to the planet than dedicated colonists at first, despite the planet's modestly fertile lands and deep, rich oceans. Two factors inhibited the early efforts to truly settle - rather than merely exploit - Alrakis. &#xD; The first is the planet's high gravity, which limited travel to the most hardy of settlers and workers, and their ships, but far more difficult to contend with was the dominant life-form, the vicious and territorial tigerfalcon. Adapted to the planet's high gravity, the tigerfalcon - a man-sized avian with black-striped, furlike feathers, a serrated beak, and four clawed feet - is much more powerful than any terrestrial bird of prey, and has been known to attack even small work parties in flocks of three to five. Hunting the tigerfalcon became not merely a sport but a matter of self-defense for the early Alrakan settlers. By the Star League era, the tigerfalcon menace had been contained enough to allow for widespread colonization, mostly centered on the large inland lakes and the metal-rich mountains of the northern Skopje continent.&#xD; Today, Alrakis remains an important mining and manufacturing world , exporting all manner of heavy industrial equipment, including heavy IndustrialMech designs and personal-support weaponry. Heavy military industry, discouraged by centuries of continuous raiding by House Steiner , never found a home on Alrakis. However, what this planet lacks in military sophistication, it more than makes up for in powerful native infantry defenders, a bonus made possible by mankind's adaptation to the local gravity.&#xD; The planetary capital city, Sigmundrac, is located on the northern edge of the large Lake Carantha on Skopje. Tarowena, a spaceport city and home to Desmond Arms, a maker of personal weaponry ranging from knives to heavy support lasers, is located on the southern supercontinent of Strumm. The equatorial continents of Kabast and Ronigawa are comparatively uninhabited, due to their inhospitable jungles, which are also the last major refuge of the native tigerfalcon.</Description>

    <Description>Young, hot, and in every way cursed with an oppressive atmosphere, many feel that Altais was colonized solely out of human stubbornness and some early settler's thirst for a challenge. More practical critics have suggested that the plentiful metal ores constantly churned up by the planet's many volcanoes drew those seeking fortune through mining and manufacturing industries. In fact, the first settlers to come to Altais came during a geologically brief dormant period in its development, when the planet's atmosphere was much more terrestrial and its surface far less unstable. &#xD; Within less than a century of the first colonies' establishment on Altais, however, a massive shift in the planet's three large tectonic plates began when a stray meteor - the remnant of a failed second planet in the Altais system -slammed into the shallow waters close to a major fault line. The shifting plates created a series of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions across the planet, destroying several cities over the next few decades. Ever since that fateful event, Altais has remained an unstable and less than hospitable world.&#xD; Though the initial city-leveling disasters have dwindled to extreme rarity, active fault lines and volcanoes still mar all four of the planet�s main continents, transforming much of what once were fertile tropical and wooded lands into a mix of scarred, rocky wastes. A side effect of the constant eruptions has been the gradual tainting of Altais� atmosphere with greenhouse gases that have raised the temperature a full twelve degrees over the last five centuries and caused the extinction of thousands of native plant and animal species.&#xD; Yet, despite all these hazards, the people of Altais have continued to work the lands and exploit the mineral wealth of this world. The capital city, Gaines, located on the southern polar continent of Tanzaria, is home to four mining and refining corporations that supply raw materials for every application from commercial power generation to heavy military hardware. Novaya Kyev, a domed city on the equatorial continent of Greater Elauria, maintains shipping ports for both off-world and transoceanic traffic.

    <Description>[3030] While Dame Humphreys suspected that the Capellans were a spent force, she had no intention of letting the remnant state overrun her much smaller nation. The CCAF was broken, she believed, but it still retained substantially more troops than she could command. As such, a key strand of the Andurien-Canopus invasion plan attempted to keep the Liaos guessing, targeting a variety of worlds and then pulling back. The unit assigned this operation in the opening stages of the war was the mercenary Carson�s Renegades, who had been displaced in the FWLM withdrawal from worlds near Terra and had accepted a two-year contract with the independent Duchy. &#xD; Their initial target would be Altorra, coreward of the line of advance but a potential target, the raiding of which might draw off CCAF troops. The renegades met no resistance to their landings on Altorra in November 3030, and little after they�d secured their landing zone. The short, sharp campaign that followed could easily have forced the world�s capitulation, and the world�s government broadcast a request to treat with the invaders, but the mercenary commander followed his orders precisely, making their presence clearly visible while causing minimal damage and loss of life. At the end of the November they boosted off-world and struck at their next target, Fronde, with equal success.</Description>

    <Description>Alula Australis was originally a Steiner world, but was conquered by Geralk Marik in 2458. Steiner forces attempted to retake the world in 2463, but were soon drawn into a stalemate. The introduction of the first Free Worlds League 'Mechs in 2470 turned the tide in favor of the Marik's troops. The independence celebrations lasted for over five weeks, during which more people were arrested for disorderly conduct than had been detained by the military police in the entire seven years of fighting.&#xD; Perhaps in memory of that conquest, the people of Alula Australis welcomed the opportunity for their world to be the site of the first full-scale BattleMech manufacturing centre in the Free Worlds. Unfortunately, this made them a prime target during all three Succession Wars. Four times the facilities have been destroyed: twice by House Steiner, once by House Liao, and once by House Marik to prevent them from falling into Steiner hands. After the forth destruction in 2947, Captain-General Brock Marik decide to relocate the facilities to Savannah, which is farther from the Steiner border.&#xD; This caused a considerable depression of Alula Australis's economy for half a century. The planet experienced a revival, however, when veins of rare earths and gemstones were discovered in the mountain ranges outside the planetary capital of New Horizon City in the late 2990s, and today these valuable exports form the basis for a mining and refining industry. The rare earths are being used in the chemistry industry located in the cities of Cirebon, Lengkong, and Mosiro.&#xD; All three of Alula Australis's major landmasses - Auroria in the northern hemisphere, Hume and Locke in the southern - boast major industrial centers. New Horizon City is located on the southern peninsula of Auroria, while Sturgeon, home to the planet's largest chemical corporation, AA PolyChem Unlimited, dominates the central Hubbes River Valley on Hume.</Description>

    <Description>Thanks to the presence of an abnormally huge gas giant in the system�s outermost orbit, Alya follows an elongated revolutionary cycle around its sun and has created an equally peculiar orbital path for Xanadu, Alya�s single large moon. The effects of these eccentric orbits have created such unusual day/night and seasonal cycles for Alya that travelers to this world are given complicated native calendars and urged to use these in place of the galactic standard during their stay to minimize confusion.&#xD; The first colonists on Alya were drawn to the abundant mineral and fuel resources locked beneath the planet's many parched badlands, particularly on the rocky northern hemispheric continent of Paroasis. Agriculture, hampered by the extreme winter and summer cycles and a lack of freshwater sources, was restricted to controlled hydroponic efforts that relied on imported water, and failed to do more than support the needs of the planet. Despite the handicaps, however, Alya thrived, supported by its local industries, which primarily produced plastics and refined fuels for all manner of internal combustion engines.&#xD; Alya suffered few serious raids or changing of hands during the Succession Wars, as there were always more strategically important worlds nearby for an enemy to attack. The capital city and commercial center of Alya, LeSabrea, is located on Paroasis, on the western shores of the landlocked Saline Sea, while the bulk of the planet's industrial might is headquartered five hundred kilometers east, in Flerise City. The southern continents of Zenishli and Desije, by comparison, are sparsely populated, covered mostly by unspoiled evergreen wilderness and a mix of rolling hills and abrupt mountain chains.</Description>

    <Description>An independent member-state of the League since 2335, Amity spent its first 450 years of its membership as a prosperous, non-controversial industrial state. Its four great cities of Freewheel, Oxbridge, Ruhr, and the island megalopolis of Stryker produced everything from Galleon light tanks and Farley speeders to Sonnheim and Four Winds musical synthesizers and recording equipment. Since the Succession Wars, however, Amity has become both a military and political battlefield.&#xD; On the military front, the planet has been raided or attacked by enemy forces on 23 separate occasions. The Lyran Commonwealth has occupied this planet twice, between 2837 and 2858, and for 30 months in 2980-2982. The early battles of the war destroyed much of Amity's industry, which was then further pillaged by the Lyan garrison during the final months of 2858. Between 2863-2865, however, Captain General Philippa Marik dispatched a team of scientists to help the populace restore these factories to full productivity. Today the planet is once again able to provide a decent standard of living for its citizens and actually has a positive balance of trade.&#xD; Instead of gratitude for this effort, however, the leaders of Amity have become increasingly critical of the Mariks, spearheading the passage of the Home Defense Act, and uniting with five of its fellow principalities in the mutual defense association known as the "Silver Hawks". Three years ago, First minister Richards and MP Sir Charles Smith made the most radical break of all - concluding an independent peace treaty with the neighboring Lyran world of Solaris. Janos Marik and Minister of Defense Erin McQuarrie have renounced this treaty as invalid, but have thus far refrained from making any kind of attack against Amity or Solaris (knowing their fragile coalition of supporters would not back such a move). The absence of retaliation has made Charles Smith's cries for a full-fledged peace settlement even louder on the floor of Parliament.&#xD; Amity's large, widespread islands are linked by maglev trains and Ground Effect Vehicle (GEV) causeways. The planet features a tropical atmosphere with temperate zones near the poles. Hurricanes are commonplace, and the tremendous cost of constant rebuilding keeps the economy unbalanced.</Description>

Today, the "lost" colonies of the first settlers remain on the large, southern continent of Gastiogne - a reminder of those who came before, and cared for by the descendants of the second wave as historical sites. Visitors to Ancha must receive regular inoculations against the viral taint before and during their stay.&#xD; Ancha is home to numerous small industries, primarily focused on the automotive and civilian aircraft industries.

Hanse Davion had the flowers harvested and conveyed up to a command circuit of JumpShips to carry them to Terra in time for the ceremony.&#xD; That romantic gesture created a demand for Mycosia the like of which had never been seen in the annuls of mercantilism.

When the Magistracy declared war on House Liao shortly before their contract expired, the MAF offered the Bees a follow-on contract to fight alongside their students, the Magistracy Militia, in the campaign. This brought the two units to Andarmax, an �easy target� intended to give the inexperienced Militia the opportunity to test their skills. Though notionally subordinate to the Canopian line unit, the Killer Bees guided the Militia to a swift and relatively bloodless victory, taking command of Andarmax less than a week after landing in December 3030.&#xD; [3034] MacGraw�s Marauders, the Killer Bees, and the Magistracy Militia knew full well the CCAF would soon come gunning for them, but when Liao assault vessels appeared in the system on 9 August 3034 they breathed a sigh of relief that it was �only� Kamakura�s Hussars and the fifth McCarron�s regiment, Rob�s Renegades, rather than House Dai Da Chi. Against these, they thought, stood a slim (if vain) hope of victory.&#xD; The CCAF force quickly disabused them of that notion, staging a combat drop and quickly moving to attack the Canopian positions. Two days of close-in fighting against the Capellans convinced the two mercenary units that escape was the best plan of action, but the MAF mercenary liaison officer attached to the Militia refused, instead ordering them both into the path of Rob�s Renegades. &#xD; The Marauders complied (and were trounced by the larger formation) but the Killer Bees refused, citing their contractual right to avoid unnecessary damage in a futile situation, which Andarmax was. They terminated their contact and signaled their intention to withdraw, which the CCAF troops allowed. McGraw�s Marauders escaped two days later, a shadow of their former selves, while the Magistracy Militia was largely wiped out.</Description>

    <Description>[3039] Neither Colonel Archibald McCarron nor his regimental commanders found much comfort in the post-Fourth Succession War era. The Chancellor was becoming more and more paranoid. While first Maximilian and now Romano Liao had left them mostly to their own devices, they knew that would not last forever. They welcomed any hope of battle, for they knew that would at least keep the Chancellor and her evil eye from targeting them as she had struck out at so many of her other military leaders.&#xD; Archie McCarron was surprised when three CCAF senior colonels visited him on Menke in May of 3039, and all but stunned when they suggested he undertake an operation of such magnitude into the Federated Suns. But as he looked over the intelligence reports that they had brought with them, McCarron was quickly won over. This was by no means a full-fledged invasion, however; the CCAF was still far too weak to even consider such a possibility. &#xD; In fact, this was designed to be more of a morale-building exercise, more than anything else. The CCAF had just recently driven the Canopians from their nation, but that victory was tempered by the fact that it took five years of military action to do so. The CCAF needed was a true victory, one that was unmistakable and could proclaim to the entire Human Sphere that the Confederation was once again a military power, and who better to target than the mighty Federated Suns.&#xD; The fourth of the Big Mac�s nine raids struck Andro on 7 August. By this time, word of the previous strikes on Alcyone, Bethel and Monhegan had reached Marshal Bergen Richmond on Kathil, who then turned around and immediately issued an advisory to worlds within the Coreward Combat Theater, warning them of the potential for attack. So when the Fourth MAC, Carhart�s Demons, under the command of Colonel Nicholas Carhart, landed on the world, the Andro Militia had already put out the order to mobilize.&#xD; Of course, the militia, with its conventional units, was still no match for an entire BattleMech regiment. Nevertheless, they put up a far stronger fight than the mercenaries had expected, inflicting relatively heavy damage on both the second and third battalions before the Demons wiped them out. That process took nearly the entire week, however, giving Colonel Carhart and his troops little time to raid the world itself. In fact, the militia�s strong defense nearly forced them to set back their timetable just so that they would have enough time to scour the battlefields for salvageable equipment. As it was, the regiment just barely made it off the world on 14 August, and even then had to endure two days of 2-G acceleration to ensure they could make it to Monongahela on time.</Description>

Over the last 150 years, it�s military forces have seldom seen combat, but wear more honors and decorations than the Marik Hall of Heroes. Although its leaders are descendants of men who helped forge the Free Worlds League, they often seem bent on tearing it apart.  &#xD; Though much-contested, Andurien has the distinction of having never been heavily damaged by an invading force. Its defenders have traditionally been more willing to offer their services to attackers rather than to let them devastate the planet. The planet still has the appearance of a wealthy, populous world, though MechWarriors (and their war machines) are not an uncommon sight. Andurien is most famous for its extensive Botanical Gardens, which boast samples of rare plants and trees from across the Inner Sphere. It was built by the hypochondriac Duke Allard of Andurien in the late twenty-fifth century.&#xD; The primacy of the Humphreys family has never been seriously questioned, despite the sometimes erratic actions of its ruling scions. Even today, the political climate in the capital city Jojoken appears as serene as the famed botanical gardens that stretch to the north of the city. It appears likely, however, that the loyalty of the people of Andurien will be put to its strongest test ever if Dame Catherine goes through with her plans to secede from the League (with the help of Kyalla Centrella, the Magistrix of Canopus).&#xD; [3050] Though there have been no major uprisings since Andurien's unsuccessful bid for independence in 3030, a certain amount of civil unrest is constant in the duchy. Enemies of the Free Worlds League will find vital military intelligence readily available here, along with other types of assistance.

Because almost 90% of the planet's bodies of water are tainted with the chemical citrium (a natural depressant that can slow the human metabolism to dangerous levels), life on Angell II has always been heavily dependant on iceships and water purification technologies. Nonetheless, the world has plenty of mineral resources (especially radium and caesium) and has been one of the Marik Commonwealth's biggest sources of wealth for centuries.&#xD; The terrain of Angell II forms a weirdly beautiful landscape. The toxic water supply, has transmuted many plants and animals recognizable as variants of Terran life into unusual, more deadly forms. The planet features vaguely Terra-like geographic formations and climate, and so will seem familiar to students of life on the cradle of humanity.&#xD; The societal structure of Angell II is stratified between the powerful few, who have access to water purification technology, and the drones, who either receive a meager ration of pure water from their employers or rely on crude, unreliable "homecookers." As the depredations of the Succession Wars have widened the breach still further, the drones' unrest has more than once erupted into violence. During the most recent raid on the planet in 3019, it is rumored that a number of drone partisans fought side-by-side with the Lyrans, though a series of arrests and trials produced no concrete evidence.</Description>

By the time of the First Star League, the population's standard of living had improved considerably under Hegemony rule.

Anthropologists have found the tenets of this religion follow the usual course (the miraculous visitors from the sky, their magical powers, the promise, either explicit or inferred, to return), but the anthropologists discovered something else as well.&#xD; More than eight hundred kilometers from the nearest permanent structure, the natives of the Annapolis tribe have constructed a six-meter high statue of Kerensky. It is a perfect likeness carved in solid granite, a type of stone that does not appear in nature on Annapolis.</Description>

    <Description>A hot, dry world slightly smaller than Terra, Antallos consists mostly of rough terrain and hard baked deserts. A small patch of jungle runs along the equatorial belt, and the world has two small polar caps. Antallos' surface is a single land mass with no oceans. Several seas dot the surface, only one of which contains any sizable islands. &#xD; In the late twenty-seventh century a conglomeration of trading companies from the Federated Suns, Draconis Combine, Outworlds Alliance and Terran Hegemony settled the Hegemony's outpost world of Antallos. Though nominally governed by the Hegemony, Antallos functioned as neutral ground and so quickly became a prosperous independent center of interstellar trade in the region. Acknowledging Antallos's growing importance, the Star League government established several bases on the planet to safeguard it against pirate raids - and also to keep an eye on the often troublesome governments of the Combine and Outworlds Alliance.&#xD;Antallos became a treasure trove of high technology, and this treasure proved its undoing after the Star League's collapse. Repeated raids by the Draconis Combine forces during the First Succession War shattered the planetary government, and Antallos devolved into a collection of squabbling city-states vying for dominance as the Succession Wars raged around them.&#xD; More than 30 city-states dot Antallos' surface and contain almost all of its population. To remain outside a city is to invite certain death from either the elements or marauders. In the lawless areas between the cities, known as Free Zones, gangs and nomad tribes roam in search of hapless travelers from which to steal the necessities of life. Many areas within the Free Zones are also contaminated with chemicals and other biohazards from the chemical and biological weapons used in the city-states' wars.&#xD; Over centuries of war and technological backsliding, Antallos has become a hiding place for fugitives and wandering pirate bands. Along with the criminals came occasional traders, adventurers and LosTech prospectors in search of whatever Star League technology might have escaped destruction. By the beginning of the thirty-first century, Antallos possessed a reputation for being a place where anything and anyone could be brought for the right price. The world reclaimed its past prominence as neutral ground for trading, but this time geared toward the underworld and criminal elements. The major center of criminal activity is Port Krin, the largest city-state of the planet. &#xD; Native to Antallos, the rock gila is a carnivorous, dog-sized lizard that is excellently adapted to the world's arid atmosphere. Many gilas extend their hunting grounds to the scattered cities and other human settlements, where they mostly prey on rats and other vermin weaker than they are. Their choice of prey makes them quite popular among Antallos' human population.&#xD; Gilas are quite aggressive and dangerous, but they can be trained to hunt rats or to bite opponents. Some traders in Port Krin even sell rock gilas to visitors as pets.</Description>

    <Description>[3050] Of minor strategic importance to the Federated Commonwealth, the world of Antares was only lightly defended by a militia battalion and a series of fortifications constructed by the locals. Clan Jade Falcon's Star League records named Antares as the site of an SLDF replenishment and resupply base, and so the Falcon Khans ordered the base taken at all costs. Gyrfalcon Galaxy landed on Antares, in July 3050, with heavy aerospace support and destroyed the planetary militia's fighters on the ground. The capital, Antares City, fell quickly, despite the militia's valiant effort. The town of Alba proved harder to take. &#xD; Unknown to its inhabitants, Alba was situated almost on top of the old Star League base. Because Alba contained the planet's largest water purification plant, the battle there was among the bloodiest of the forth wave. The Falcons, initially reluctant to risk damaging the water purifier by using massed airstrikes, suffered severe casualties, especially the Second Falcon Jaegers. When Khan Crichell's logistics officers informed him that Jumpships could deliver a water purifier from Clan space in two and a half months, Crichell ordered the fighters to bomb the town flat. The stunned survivors watched as the Jade Falcon engineers unearthed the huge Star League base beneath their town.&#xD; The Star League-era supplies and the base facility made Antares a valuable prize. When ilKhan Ulric Kerensky forced Clan Jade Falcon to share control of Antares with Clan Steel Viper, he precipitated a brutal series of Trials of Possession for the base which increased the Falcons� hatred for their fellow Clan.</Description>

    <Description>Only Kentares IV exceeds the world of Apollo in the annals of infamy: Apollo once served as the capital of the Rim world Republic and the homeworld of House Amaris.&#xD; A small G5 star with a single habitable world orbiting it, Apollo was settled on September 8 2250, by Hector Worthington Rowe and his band. Rowe modeled his new homeland on his own warped interpretation of Plato, his favorite classical author. The women whom he had ripped from their families on Lucianca were given the option of citizenship in Rowe�s Republic by contracting marriages with Rowe�s henchmen, or of being demoted to servitor status for use as cheap labor. Recognizing the need to preserve what little technology they had, Rowe furthered decreed that individuals possessing scientific or technical skills be except from mundane tasks so that they might concentrate on more important duties. Despite the manner of its conception, Rowe�s Republic not only survived its initial years of hardship, but also thrived in the years to come.&#xD; In 2376, leadership of the Republic passed from House Rowe to House Durant. At this time the new ruler, Lord Michael Durant could boast that his Rim Worlds Republic consisted of 23 inhabited star systems, over 12 billion citizens, and two million soldiers. House Durant would rule the Republic for the next nine decades, before the rulership passed to House Amaris.&#xD; In 2459, with Lady Heather Durant, childless, unmarried, without close relatives, and approaching middle age, appointed Terens Amaris her heir apparent. When Lady Durant died suddenly of a previously undiagnosed heart condition in 2463, Lady Amaris took the reins of the Republican government. Her descendants would rule in unbroken succession until 2779, when General Aleksandr Kerensky executed Stephan Amaris for his crimes.&#xD; The Republic itself faired little better, after being conquered by Kerensky in 2767 as a base of operations for the Civil War. In the years following the Civil War, the Republic slowly disintegrated into dozens of tiny Bandit Kingdoms until by 2786, nothing remained.&#xD; [3050] The Turkina Keshik and Jade Falcon Galaxy, escorted by three Stars of aerospace fighters, landed on Apollo in May 3050, halfway through the planet's monsoon season. The weather prevented the Falcon OmniFighters from effectively supporting the ground forces. Both Falcon forces met with heavy resistance from the Apollo Militia and the Second Grave Walkers, a mercenary unit of some repute. The Jade Falcon Galaxy made quick initial progress, but the fierce resistance put up by the Grave Walkers was compounded by the bad weather.&#xD; Superior Clan technology and skills finally prevailed, and the defenders retreated to two massive fortifications built by Stephan Amaris just prior to the Civil War, and were patterned on the Castles Brian in the Terran Hegemony. One fortress fell easily after several Stars of Elementals, slipped in through a hidden bolt-hole shown of the Jade Falcon's pre-Exodus records. The other fort proved more difficult. Eventually the Falcons resorted to using the Arrow-IV missile artillery to silence the fort's big guns, and to open access for the OmniMechs and Elementals to the underground of the fortress. Two hours after the second fort fell, the rest of Apollo's defenders also surrendered unconditionally.</Description>

    <Description>Originally colonized by settlers from the Capellan Hegemony, Arboris was settled for its fertile ground. Arboris has three continents. The largest, Jeruc � named after the scout who surveyed the planet � is located in the northern hemisphere. Covering over 38 percent of the planet, Jeruc produces the majority of the planet�s agro-products from its vast flat plains and valleys. The largest plain, Kansas Plateau, is home to the capital, Kansas Plain, which located in the southwest portion of the continent. Kansas Plateau wheat grows taller than the largest BattleMechs. In the north and west of Jeruc are the vast Hardina Mountains, which have proved as stubborn as the planet�s people. The majority of the population is located on Jeruc, where many are farmers or work to support the planet�s major industry. &#xD; The remaining continents � Silverado and Bandar � are more island continents, about equal in size to Terra�s Australia. Here the industries are timber and mineral mining. The people of Arboris have a history of fierce independence. Before their actions in the Chaos March conflict, they proved their mettle in 2308 by seceding from the Capellan Hegemony to protest the rapacious taxes and debilitating draft imposed by that government to support an unjustifiable war. &#xD; Though Arboris again returned under the Capellan umbrella soon after the end of the Capellan-Supremacy War, neither House Liao nor later, House Davion, succeeded in fully assimilating the populace. When Capellan forces invaded Arboris during the break up of the Sarna March in 3057, the citizens refused to submit to them. Led by commanders of the Farmers Freedom Army, they rose up against the invaders and through sheer willpower forced the Capellans off the continent of Jeruc. The former Arboris militia forces suffered the same fate.</Description>

    <Description>Arc-Royal is a pleasant, pastoral world of mild weather and remarkable beauty. It is also home to one of the most legendary mercenary forces ever to stride the battlefield, as well as the equally formidable renegade warriors of Clan Wolf (in-Exile). The fact that Arc-Royal is now the capital of a Lyran Alliance Theater only increases its prestige as a symbol of military strength in the region, and mercenaries flock to the world for a chance to be a part of something big.&#xD; Compared to Harlech and Solaris City, the capital of Arc-Royal � Old Connaught � looks nothing like a mercenaries� haven. Sited on the shores of Lachlna lake, it retains something of a �home town� appearance. The streets are clean, the architecture reminiscent of nineteenth-century Germany and the people uncommonly friendly despite the influx of warriors in their midst. Most inhabitants of Old Connaught are proud of their Lyran heritage and their link to the Kells, who claim stewardship of the planet. Kell Hound security troops, often backed by LAAF infantry or local police, are a common sight on the streets, yet few see their armed presence as intrusive or even intimidating.&#xD; Mercenaries new to Arc-Royal are asked to register with Old Connaught�s Visitor�s Centre at the nearby spaceport, where they are also expected to stow their machines and leave all but one sidearm behind before venturing into the city and stopping by the Warrior�s Hall. The helps keep the atmosphere in the Arc-Royal capital peaceful, even when local Clansmen stop by for a visit.&#xD; Hiring and recruiting activities in Old Connaught take place in Warrior�s Hall, a recent addition to the city skyline that stands a few blocks south of the Office of the Grand Duke, Old Connaught�s capital building. Nowhere near as grand in size and design as the Hiring Hall on Outreach, the Warrior�s Hall is nonetheless an impressive structure, a vaguely pyramid-shaped tower that stands twelve stories high. The Hall features conference rooms and offices for mercenary brokers and employer representatives, as well as a communications centre tied into the city�s Class-A HPG station.&#xD; Though currently lacking MRBC support, the Old Connaught Warrior�s Hall is already developing a reputation for promoting fair business dealings between employers and local mercenaries. Much of this is attributed to the presence of accomplished Kell Hounds negotiators at the Hall, all of whom are available for freelance work on behalf of less savvy mercenary commands.&#xD; In addition to the Kell Hounds, Clan Wolf (in-Exile) has its primary enclave on Arc-Royal. Nicknamed Wolf City, the Warden Wolf enclave is a sprawling mix of temporary and semi-permanent structures bracketed by military bases and factories that constantly remain under improvement or expansion. Traffic between the enclave and the rest of Arc-Royal is tightly controlled, with Clan and Kell Hound units maintaining secure checkpoints as far from the enclave as a full kilometer, and near-constant �Mech and battle armor patrols providing additional defense farther in.</Description>

    <Description>One of the original five worlds settled by the Exodus fleet in 2786, Arcadia superficially resembles its namesake. Though water covers only 50% of its surface, the planet supports considerable dense vegetation and a fully developed ecosystem. Many analogues to Terran flora exist on Arcadia, including the Arcadian mammoth, a large hairy herbivorous mammal with huge tusks and an extended snout, and the Arcadian russet, a mahogany-like hardwood. The world's colonists also introduced a number of Terran species, modified to survive Arcadia's environmental conditions. Most notable of these is the cloud cobra, which soon carved out a niche for itself in the misty equatorial jungles. The colonists also attempted to introduce the cobra to the temperate grasslands, but the native steel viper decimated the cobra nests within months of the cobras' release.&#xD; The presence of a harmful virus in the atmosphere caused many deaths among early colonists before the development of counter-agents. Some areas of the planet suffered earthquakes and intense volcanic activity; these were a source of many valuable minerals, prompting the establishment of extensive mining camps. Some particularly beautiful areas, such as the southern islands, became vacation resorts, while the rich soils of the Aeschal Plateau were ideal for growing genetically modified foodstuffs. Arcadia's relative abundance of resources had its downside, however. Considerable fighting took place on Arcadia in the Exodus Civil War, devastating most of the planet's cities and industrial centers. As farmers and workers were drafted into the armies of the petty warlords, the planetary economy collapsed, causing widespread famine and death.&#xD; Reconstruction took many years. As with Inner Sphere worlds devastated in the Succession Wars, the use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons rendered many cities uninhabitable for centuries. The ruins of cities and military enclosures dot the Arcadian countryside. The planetary capital of Rivera was spared such destruction, and today serves as neutral ground for the three Clans present on Arcadia. A forth Clan, the Blood Spirits, withdrew to their colony world of York in 3059. Administrative and mercantile facilities occupy most of Rivera, along with the Hall of Arcadia. Made of local iron-rich granite, it serves as a meeting hall and houses the command mechanisms for the planetary SDS system. Aerospace bases on the world's single moon provided additional protection against attack.</Description>

Today, Arcturus is an agricultural world barely able to coax enough food from the soil to feed itself.  What few hidden resources the planet has are processed in the one remaining industrial city, Malcheema.  Human beings are Arcturus's only real export.  Though the nine Arcturan Guards regiment are composed of men and women from all over the Commonwealth, tradition dictates that over a quarter of each regiment's personnel must be from Arcturus.  Though Arcturans are not particularly warlike, they have a tradition of dedication to the Lyran Commonwealth.  It is a great honor to have a son or daughter in a Guards regiment.  Native Arcturans are also eagerly recruited for armored and infantry regiments stationed throughout the Commonwealth.</Description>

The savage campaigns fought in the Tintavel system in 2412, between the Free Worlds League and the Capellan Confederation, caused massive loss of civilian life. Appalled at this, Chancellor Aleisha Liao, spent months drafting an 80-page document describing conditions for "civilized warfare," rules intended to spare civilians from the horrors of unlimited war. Aleisha dispatched copies of her work to the leaders of all the warring realms, but expected only a lukewarm response. Instead, most of the leaders immediately communicated their wholehearted agreement. &#xD; Encouraged by the response, Aleisha immediately suggested a summit meeting on the Capellan world of Ares to further discuss the document. After much negotiation, the Ares Conventions were signed in the Grand Hall of the city of New Olympia on June 13, 2413.&#xD; Today, ironically, Ares maintains one of the few Capellan 'Mech producing centers left in existence.&#xD; [3030] Though the Ares factories are still rebuilding from the devastation of the Forth Succession War, it is on Ares that the Capellans have chosen to experiment with developing a stable, triple-strength myomer.&#xD; The destruction of most of the Quikscell Company's component lines at their Ares plant has actually led to their putting out a higher-quality product.

Even the steps descending to the dungeons were artificially shaped to hint at millennia of wear.&#xD; Residing in the subtropical swamps of Argyle is the giant carnivorous plant known as Randall�s rose. Its roots and leaves extend more than six meters from a central trunk with several small branches full of rose-like, delightful smelling-flowers. The bottoms of those tough leaves are impregnated with a strong adhesive substance for up to half their length. If something gets glued to it, the leaf will excrete more glue along with a subduing poison to prevent the victim�s escaping; the plant often catches small predators trying to rob it of its prey.&#xD; Shoots of Randall�s rose are exported to many worlds, where they are used as gag gifts. Commonly sold shoots are usually 40 to 50 cm long; after new leaves come in, the plants are excellent for capturing neckties or perhaps the beard of a careless owner. However, if left to grow unchecked, they can easily become a genuine menace.&#xD; [3062] The first sparks of the FedCom civil war started brewing in early 3062, when Archon Katherine Steiner-Davion made the fateful decision to garrison worlds showing loyalty to her brother, with troops fanatically loyal to her. Rather than quell the growing discontent, the Archon�s actions served only to fuel the flames.

    <Description>Originally viewed as something of a cult when they formed in 2911, the Worshippers of the Great Delphi on the world of Aristotle revived the ancient polytheistic religion of Terra�s ancient Greco-Roman cultures before the rise of Christianity, and have maintained their faith to this day. Though the religion is largely a collection of fables and anecdotes that even its own founders doubt are grounded in reality, the metaphorical teachings of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and the underlying currents of their belief structures, have been re-examined in this new religion, which earned the name Delphism after the Great Delphi Temple that brought it back.&#xD; Though many adherents of monotheistic religions mock the Delphists, this faith has gained popularity, particularly since the resurgence of the Aesirians. Like the Aesirians, Delphists believe that a god or demi-god personifies most abstract concepts and that said deities require tribute in order to assure favorable results in any venture.&#xD;&#xD; Moreover, followers of Delphism believe that the future can be known by offering tributes to the gods, and so many worshippers occasionally make pilgrimages to Aristotle, to curry favor with their patron god or goddess and to make an offering at the Oracle of Delphi. After elaborate ceremonies, the Blessed of Delphi are then entrusted with a vision that can be either profoundly personal or grand in scope. It is said that one such vision, received by High Priestess Persephone Atwood in 3055, foretold Archon Melissa Steiner-Davion�s assassination and the collapse of the Federated Commonwealth, and even pointed a suggestive finger at Katherine Steiner-Davion as the usurper. Though dismissed as mere rumor, the mysterious circumstances surrounding Atwood�s disappearance in the summer of 3057 have many conspiracy theorists suggesting foul play and lending credence to the prophetic possibilities of Delphism.&#xD; [3064] During the FedCom Civil War, Allied forces struck at Aristotle as part of the second thrust of Operation Scatter, a diversionary action designed to overload the LAAF�s ability to respond. &#xD; Facing little resistance, the Twenty-Third Arcturan Guards quickly moved on to their next objective.</Description>

    <Description>[3025] The city of Amsterdam is home to the headquarters of Green Star Emergency, who represent an experiment by the Davion government to privatize certain emergency services in the frontier region of the Outback. Green Star runs and operates several old freighters and DropShips and controls a large stockpile of resources. When Green Star receives word of an emergency, such as a bandit raid or natural disaster, it quickly negotiates a contract with the stricken world, then speedily transports needed supplies and personnel to the disaster area. If this system proves successful, the Davion government will probably set up similar arrangements in other sections of the Outback.</Description>

    <Description>A rare habitable planet found orbiting a white subdwarf star that older star charts still refer to as Zeta Sagittarius, Ascella is a very young, hot, and geologically unstable world. The presence of abundant raw materials close to the surface and scattered across the floors of its shallow oceans drew settlers here in the early colonial era, despite the presence of an atmosphere still laced with ammonia and carbon dioxide. Particularly dense metals, including some highly radioactive ores, were among Ascella's most common natural treasures, and also help to explain the above-average gravitational field of this medium-sized world. &#xD; When first discovered, native algae and a kind of wild brush had only begun to transform Ascella's atmosphere into something breathable by humans, but a century of terraforming was still required to cleanse the remaining taint to the point where respirators became unnecessary. Freed from their domed settlements, the cities and mining townships established early in the planet's colonization expanded across the northern continents of Askahr, Niejawa, and Quarenir, and the south polar continent of Saufell, leaving only the unbearably hot equatorial landmasses of Aytagrad and Ogleca untouched by man.&#xD; Though a major exporter of heavy metals and radioactive elements, as well as small fusion and electric engines for civilian and light military vehicles, Ascella was raided only a handful of times throughout the Succession Wars, and spent most of that time under the banner of the Draconis Combine. The planetary capital of Tarawa is located on the Saebeth River, in the southern peninsula of Askahr.</Description>

In the case of Asellus Borealis, the planet�s local militia declared for Anton at the very start of the revolt. &#xD; Rushed from Stewart, the Juggernaut landed on Asellus Borealis in July 3014, only to meet with fierce resistance from the militia. Initially the Juggernaut�s BattleMechs dominated the fighting, but when the rebels went to ground and launched a guerrilla campaign, the Stewart Dragoons regiment found itself ill suited to the task of rooting out small cells of resistance from the towering residential blacks of Asellus Borealis� cities. Months of bombings, gas attacks, and sniper activity inflicted heavy casualties on the loyalists.&#xD; By September 3015, the loyalist Juggernaut regiment was still bogged down in fighting guerrilla forces. The arrival of a SAFE anti-terrorist taskforce finally gave the loyalists the skills and equipment needed to quell the rebellion on this world.</Description>

    <Description>In forming the Alliance of Galedon, the shrewd politician Shiro Kurita played various worlds fears off against each other, promising to aid one world against their neighbors, and then offer the same to these same neighbors. Eventually these political dealings came to light and within a few months, each major planetary lord had learned of the means Kurita had used to win their pledges.&#xD; To some, this was an outrage. Others simply continued to honor and accept the Alliance of Galedon as an official ruling body and ally. Resistance to Kurita's authority was greatest on the worlds of Benjamin, and Asgard. The local leaders of these worlds were indignant and felt that they had been both manipulated and betrayed. Instead of taking out their aggressions on their neighbors, as had been the custom, they became hostile toward Shiro Kurita, sending numerous communiqu�s expressing their resentment in explicit detail.&#xD; Later that month, the fleet and army of the Alliance of Galedon invaded Benjamin, and Asgard. Though neither of the planets mustered a substantial army, the citizens of each were devoted to their freedom and refused to submit peaceably. Casualties were enormous on both sides, as the defenders adopted old Terran guerrilla tactics, and the attackers used every known contemporary weapon except CBR (chemical, biological, and radioactive) warheads. In the end, Benjamin fell in October, and Asgard in August of 2312.&#xD; [3052] As soon as Clan Smoke Jaguar units landed on Asgard in February 3052, the defending Third Benjamin Regulars began a round-the-clock artillery bombardment. To escape the Third's guns, the Jaguars Nineteenth Striker Cluster pushed forward in a night march and arrived at Vernon, the largest city on Asgard's southern continent, a whole day before the Regulars expected them. In a fierce battle, the Third unleashed its heavy and assault 'Mechs to tie up the attackers while the rest of it forces retreated to a secondary line near the Odin's Retreat mountains. &#xD; The veteran unit dug-in and held the line for almost a month in the face of a non-stop Jaguar assault. Eventually, the assault elements of the Forth Jaguar Dragoons broke through the Third�s defenses and rolled up defending unit�s western flank. The Third pulled back across the Ragnorak Plains, fighting a running battle all the way to their DropShips. A little more than a battalion escaped Asgard intact.&#xD; [3059] During Operation Bulldog the forces of the SLDF, including the remnants of the Regulars, assaulted Asgard. Ironically, the Forth Jaguar Hussars also took cover within the Odin's Retreat mountains, though unlike the Regulars seven years earlier, they did not survive to escape off-world.</Description>

    <Description>Discovered during the 24th century, this prefecture capital is a world of high mountains and deep oceans, mostly owing to the planet�s low gravity and young geological age. The surface land is divided among three mountainous continents and a handful of island chains. Modest mineral deposits and limited expanses of arable land prevented Ashio from developing large manufacturing and agricultural industries, until the commercial potential of the planet�s extremely large native mammoths led to the rise of a ranching industry. These elephant-sized, cattle-like creatures, whose flesh is nearly indistinguishable from Terran beef � thanks to geneticists from the now-destroyed University of Ashio - helped the world attain a better-than-subsistence-level economy, becoming one of the largest exporters of beef in the galaxy. &#xD; Ashio�s most prominent geological feature is the giant Mt. Vesuvius Major. This ten-kilometer-tall volcano, said to be the largest in the Inner Sphere, is located on the southern island continent of Vesuvius Prime, at the crux of three major � if inactive � fault lines. The volcano and its surrounding lands became the center of extensive mining operations, focused on the minerals and ores churned up by ancient lava flows. Though the mountain has long been dormant, local experts have predicted that an eruption would blast enough ash and sulfur into the atmosphere to block out Ashio�s yellow sun and plunge the planet�s mild climate into an ice age.&#xD; Ashio was once home to Ashio University, a political and military college that boasted among its alumni members of the Kurita royalty. After it was destroyed in the First Succession War, a second Ashio University rose from its ruins under the auspices of the Combine�s short-lived People�s Reconstruction Effort, only to be destroyed again by a fire, believed to have been set by anti-Kurita insurgents.&#xD; Ashio�s two other continents, northeastern Rhodesia and northern Zaire, support the planet�s beef industry, with the fertile soil of the continents including the planet�s agricultural co-ops. Ashio�s capital, Iscariot, is the main distribution center, with its three Starports for exporting the beef and ores for the world.</Description>

    <Description>Astrokaszy is hot, dry, and windswept world. Dominated by a single, mammoth landmass, the world’s two oceans cling to the poles, while inland seas are too few and far between to support a thriving native agriculture. Although its limited ecosystem supports native animal life, and the world boasts generous deposits of precious stones, little else recommends this world to settlers. Astrokaszy was left largely uninhabited until the survivors and dependents of a shattered mercenary brigade, the Crimson Reapers, made planetfall here in 2892, bringing with them the heavy influence of their dominantly Muslim beliefs and customs.&#xD; Soon after their arrival, however, the Reapers’ command cohesion crumbled as various subcommanders clashed bitterly over how to use their meager resources to settle their new home. Company by company, the mercenaries fragmented into ever-smaller camps and scattered across most of the northern deserts, eventually forming the cores of the nomadic tribes and Caliphates that persist today, wearing down their remaining military strength in battle against local pirates and each other.&#xD; The society the Reapers tried to build endures in the form of small manufacturing centers and mining enclaves that often anchor the Caliphate city-states near scattered oases, and the distinctly Arabic Muslim overtones of the planet’s decidedly male-dominant culture. Still clinging to the philosophies and traditions of his ancestors, today’s Astrokaszy is a fearless fighter and horseman. Blood sports — one of the few diversions available on this barren planet — are a common pastime here, as well as the favored means among the various Caliphs and Pashas for keeping their respective subjects in line.&#xD; Even less organized and populous than Antallos, Astrokaszy is a dangerous climate for the new mercenary to seek work, lacking any rule of law beyond the will of the local Caliphate rulers. Here, there are no hiring halls, no neutral meeting centers, no training grounds, and no DropPorts. Finding an employer on this world and negotiating a contract thus carries with it all of the dangers of the mercenary trade on Antallos without even the benefit of the flimsy order imposed by local police and security forces, as what passes for law and order on Astrokaszy is often little more than the whims of the local sultan or caliph.&#xD; The closest exception to this rule is the Shervanis Caliphate and its capital city of Shervanis City. Recent conflicts, however, have ravaged even this bastion of semi-civilization, which includes both a small spaceport and the planetary HPG. A short conflict in 3058, involving Capellan, Canopian, and (allegedly) Word of Blake forces, toppled then-Caliph Malachye Shervanis and led to the rise of Caliph Srin Rashier, whose brief, two-day reign consisted almost solely of changing Shervanis City’s name to Freedom City. But his rule swiftly ended when the Avanti’s Angels mercenary command, then under Confederation employ, deposed him.&#xD; Ahmed Shervanis, Malachye’s wandering son, then returned to reclaim his birthright with a small army of followers and restored the Shervanis Caliphate to the days of Malachye. Since then, Shervanis has clashed with other Caliphates as well, including the recent war with the Rajirr Caliphate that erupted soon after Caliph Shervanis’ nephew, Badr, was found murdered, apparently on the orders of Najiyah Rajirr, his betrothed. Shervanis’ forces, which include a few&#xD;BattleMechs, remain weakened by the fighting, but — apart from Rashier’s Order of the Faithful band — they remain the strongest of all fighting groups on Astrokaszy today. &#xD; Despite the recent upheavals, the Shervanis Caliphate remains a hub of commerce and mercenary activity. Mercenaries desperate enough to do business here, however, must often do so by first negotiating with the local city rulers to gain entry into their domains and meet with any potential employer representatives who may be there. Even then, the risk of being shanghaied or killed by locals eager to gain a mercenary’s weapons and ’Mech remains uncomfortably high, as most of the local rulers would rather steal a warrior’s ride for their own troops’ use than entrust their agendas and security to a mere hireling. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon for a green mercenary, desperate for employment, to spend time running errands — often illegal and highly dangerous ones — just to stay on the local caliph’s good side in the hopes of finding that one lucky break to escape Astrokaszy forever.&#xD; All the factors that make Astrokaszy an undesirable place for mercenary commands to seek employment, however, also make it an ideal place to find recruits. Combined with the generalized urge to get off the planet, the barbaric lifestyle required to simply survive on this harsh world creates an almost endless stream of trained fighters—most of whom would jump at any opportunity to join a real mercenary command that can promise both freedom and financial security.</Description>

    <Description>A warm world, with an oppressive atmosphere and active volcanoes in all four of its great island chains, Athenry resembles prehistoric Terra in many ways. Tropical foliage and steep, rocky mountains dominate most of the four island chains that make up the planet's landmass. Too close to its sun for polar ice caps to form, the planet's most habitable regions for the early Terran colonists were the highlands of the large islands in the northern and southern latitudes, where the air is thinner and the heat more bearable. Frequent rains keep the lowlands of Athenry lush, giving rise to exotic flora and thousands of interesting animal species. &#xD; Many of the planet's native life forms, scientists learned, held great medicinal potential, leading to the founding of the Athenry Institute of Medicine on the primary northern island of Golas, in the Larsen Chain. The AIM was destroyed by a tactical nuke during the First Succession War, however, leaving only a radioactive hulk where the facilities once stood.&#xD; Athenry's capital city of New Senna is perched in the rocky mountains of Lisbon, the primary mass of the southern polar Espalar Chain. Though cities dot much of the Espalar, Zubeckis and Larsen Chains, only a few towns have been established on the mostly equatorial Wandessa Chain, largely due to the extreme temperatures and humidity of that region. Largest among these settlements is the seaport city of Ricobar, which serves as a port of call for the planet's oceangoing trade.</Description>

On the colony world of Atreus, gemstone merchants in the capital city refused a DropShip carrying two Trinaries of the First Jaguar Cavaliers permission to land. The Cavaliers landed anyway and rampaged through the capital, destroying every building and mowing down every civilian in their path. The terrified survivors appealed to the Clan Council, claiming the Right of Forgiveness and citing Nicholas Kerensky's writings about the warrior's duty to uphold justice.&#xD; Rather than shame his warriors by disciplining them for attacking Atreus's capital without orders, Khan Ian Moon publicly commended their actions and ordered the rebellious merchants punished for daring to lift a hand against MechWarriors. On the Khan's orders, the Cavaliers executed the city's merchants and their families, then razed every building in the city save for the spaceport. To prevent any recurrence of such "unnatural" rebellions against authority, Khan Moon formally stripped the Clan's lower castes of their limited right to self-governance and gave all political power into the hands of the warrior caste.&#xD; [3027] In an attempt to stop Jaguar aggression elsewhere in their holdings, Clan Star Adder brought the fight to the Jaguars on Atreus in 3027. While the bulk of Alpha Galaxy held off the Jaguars Pi Galaxy, Sigma Galaxy's 428th and 471st Star Adder Sentinels secured and held Aerospace Plant CM-T72673. Hundreds of new Jagatai and Khirgiz fighters flowed into the Adders' ranks until Jaguar Khan Leo Showers finally took the factory back in 3040.&#xD; [3060] After the Clan Smoke Jaguar's destruction, Clan Fire Mandrill and Ice Hellion absorbed the former Jaguar holdings on Atreus.

    <Description>Covered almost entirely in water, and wrapped in a thick atmosphere that traps heat and renders the few habitable island chains, near the north and south poles, only moderately so, it's almost impossible to believe that when scientists first came to this world, they had described it as a paradise. Though they did notice that the above-average atmospheric pressure and the comparative lack of protective ozone likely contributed to the planet's then-luxuriant warmth, what few colonists realized at the time was that Atria was only then coming out of the final stages of its own ice age. &#xD; Before they noticed the steady planetwide rise in temperature and humidity, however, the colonists quickly discovered that the entire ecosphere was biologically incompatible with human physiology. Though blessed with an abundance of flora and fauna that included massive marine life and atranas, flightless avians nearly double the size of Terran pheasants, the human colonists could not use any of them as a food source, and thus the planet grew dependent on its neighbors for agricultural needs.&#xD; Once part of the Terran Hegemony, Atria became a Combine holding for much of its history. However, its lack of resources and oppressive climate tended to make invaders reluctant to waste resources on its defense, so the world became known as yet another backwater of the Inner Sphere, suitable for nothing more grand than serving as a staging ground for troops in transit. Fortunately, this lack of importance spared it the worst of the Amaris Crisis and the Succession Wars. Today, Atria retains its charm as a tropical getaway for off-world tourists, though few are inclined to stay long unless they hail from more arctic planets.&#xD; The capital and primary spaceport city of Atria Prime, located on the southern polar island of Aitrakops, is thus home to a flourishing hospitality industry including hostels, casinos, and a transoceanic port for luxury liners.&#xD; Apart from being one of the plush resort worlds frequently visited by Combine nobility, Atria is also one of the official 28 worlds of the Rivera-style gambling �Circuit� for anyone able to obtain visitors� permits.</Description>

    <Description>Founded as a religious colony by Jesuit followers of St. Augustine, the former Planet 2112-8845 A has developed a broad-based society that, while retaining strong ties to the Roman Church, has become a core part of the Marik Commonwealth. The Succession Wars cost Augustine two-thirds of its population, and bitter fighting wrecked the famed Seminary along with much of the planetary infrastructure. The past century, however, saw a steady recovery as well as substantial immigration to the warm but pleasant planet.&#xD; Petrochemicals and mineral wealth dominate the northern continent of Kabuko, while agriculture (including wine production and the manufacture of fruit preserves) is the principal employer on the two other landmasses, Roma and Grecian. A fief of the Mariks since the 27th century, Augustine has traditionally served as the seat of favored members of the Captain-General�s immediate family. The current duchess is Alys Rousset-Marik, who inherited her mother�s estate (situated at Temple Ford at the mouth of the Dexter River on Roma) during the FedCom Civil War. Augustine has thus become not only a focus for religious affairs, but also more recently for League politics, its capital serving as a center for many opposed to the incumbent Captain-General. Though not officially confirmed�the government refuses to comment on security matters�SAFE has built up a substantial presence here to monitor opposition groups, many of whom are on the political fringe.</Description>

    <Description>[3067] The city of Kesterley is home to the new headquarters of Edasich Motors on Aur. The company was founded when the Edasich family (stewards of the planet Edasich in the Isle of Skye) assumed control of the Vlar Industries fusion engine plant on Edasich, and soon afterward absorbed the faltering Pitban Power Systems factory on Tentra, the large moon orbiting the nearby world of Kirkcaldy. &#xD; Since then, Edasich Motors has become a key supplier of fusion engines for Defiance Industries of Hesperus II, though the predations of the Succession Wars heavily damaged both of the company's primary engine plants, severely curtailing their output. The discovery of the Helm memory core enabled then-CEO Duke Martin Edasich to reverse this trend and make good on his plans to establish at least one of his factories farther away from the front. &#xD; Further spurred by rumors that DefHes would soon expand its Tharkan engine plants to offset the loss of Edasich productivity, the duke spared no expense in the massive undertaking for a new facility on Aur, dismantling the aging Tentra plant in the process. The Aur factory, one of the first to come on line offering extralight fusion plants for BattleMechs, reassured DefHes executives and ensured Edasich Motors' continued vitality in the post-Succession Wars era.</Description>

    <Description>A relatively uninhabited planet populated by jungles, massive forests, and deserts, helicopters are the choice for transportation on Australia; most residents earn their pilot�s licenses before they learn to drive.&#xD; [3058] The Clan Jade Falcon drive on Coventry targeted a number of intermediary worlds, including Australia. Though they knew their defense would be hopeless in the face of the overwhelming Clan force, the Australia militia valiantly engaged the invaders, sustaining horrendous casualties.&#xD; Few nations in history have survived as united realms in the absence of a single, hard currency accepted and respected by all citizens, and the Lyran Alliance is no exception. The nation�s six mints print all paper currency and press all coinage to support the hard cash needs of the Lyran economy.&#xD; Though the Alliance Reserve Bank system regulates their output, these mints are impregnable fortresses whose massive warehouses are said to be filled floor to ceiling daily with freshly minted cash. The mints are located on five worlds also occupied by the Alliance�s largest stock exchanges � Donegal, Skye, Bolan, Australia and Alarion � while a sixth stands in Tharkad City. It is said that thieves have never compromised any of these facilities since the founding of the Lyran state, making them the most secure of the nation�s financial institutions.&#xD; Interplanetary trading throughout the Alliance takes place in one of the five major stock exchanges, which are maintained by the Lyran government. Located on Australia, Bolan, Donegal, Skye and Alarion, a major Alliance Stock Exchange (ASE) facility represents each of the nation�s provinces. These exchanges provide investors with ready access to every publicly traded corporation that does interstellar-level business within the Lyran Alliance (plus a few that exist beyond Alliance borders).&#xD; Heavily reliant on the HPG network, the major Alliance Exchanges are hubs of communications and trade for stocks and commercial information, making their homeworlds a prime spot for the industry-minded to gather and follow market trends. Because they receive their information much more quickly and consistently than local trading hubs off-world (which often receive their ASE information days or weeks after the fact), investors in the larger corporations or their brokers often reside on these worlds to be as close to the action as possible.&#xD; This centralization and government administration of the major Alliance Exchanges allows the government to exercise its limited authority over business in order to ensure that insider trading and other unscrupulous investment strategies do not abuse the free market system. In support of the government�s responsibilities, the Ministry of Finance and the Alliance Business Ethics Board also maintain offices on these major exchange worlds.</Description>

    <Description>The most famous battle involving Planetlifters occurred in 3002, when a Steiner raiding force attacked the Marik planet of Autumn Wind. The Steiner task force consisted of the Union-class DropShip Bolan’s Blood and the ’Mech company Cassion’s Commandos. The DropShip and Company Commanders, Commander Reynolds and Hauptmann Cassion, had been operating together for the previous two years, ranging up and down the Marik border and hitting one world after another.&#xD; When they returned from their most recent mission, the two commanders were met by their new Task Force Commander, Leutnant Colonel O’Rielly, who had been recently reassigned to combat duty from the Administrative Section. Leutnant Colonel O'Rielly explained their new mission — a deep penetration raid into Marik space. Marik opposition was expected to be light: a few battalions of locally raised militia, three Planetlifters and a regiment of jump infantry that was refitting.&#xD; Cassion and Reynolds’s battle plan was based on their two years’ of experience with raiding Marik holdings. Autumn Wind possessed no space defense force or conventional fighters, so the Blood would land directly on the planet near the first industrial complex. The Commandos would disembark and destroy the complex with fire support from the Blood. The ’Mech company would then re-embark on the DropShip. A suborbital flight would take the Blood to the next complex, and so on down the line.&#xD; Much to the Hauptmann’s shock, Leutnant Colonel O’Rielly rejected the plan and laid out his own. Each of the Commando lances would drop from space to land 20 kilometers away from their assigned complexes, then reorganize themselves after the drop. The lance would then move to destroy the complexes. Afterward, they would rendezvous at a central point for pickup by the DropShip. This strategy, O’Rielly explained, would not allow the Marik commander to concentrate his forces in a timely manner and would allow the DropShip to land and give support to any lance that got into trouble. Cassion and Reynolds protested this new plan vigorously, but O’Rielly was adamant. When he threatened them with summary court-martial, they were forced to relent.&#xD; Colonel Joseph Yetti was the commander of the 751st Jump Regiment and was assigned temporary control of the military defenses of Autumn Wind. When informed of the Steiner force moving toward the planet, he quickly mustered the 751st, loaded them onto Planetlifters, and moved the regiment to an assembly area equidistant from the four complexes. When the Steiner drop began, Yetti loaded the 751st and hit the recon lance just as they started to move from their drop zone.&#xD; The other three lances continued their advance on the other complexes, but the local militia slowed them down. The Blood was ordered to land and support the recon lance. By the time it made planetfall, the lance had been destroyed and its attackers had vanished. Even as the Blood landed, the 751st was hitting the Commandos’ Fire Lance. The Blood lifted again to support the stricken lance, but to no avail. They arrived too late.&#xD; Two hours later, Cassion’s lance had been able to brush aside the defending militia and move to within sight of its assigned complex. At that moment, two Planetlifters flew overhead, and two battalions of the 751st were floating down toward them. Cassion could take no more. He ordered his lance to break off and called in the Blood to pick them up at a clearing ten kilometers to the north.&#xD; Yetti intercepted that signal and sent his final battalion in on the remaining Planetlifter to secure the landing zone. As the Blood started its final approach, it was met by a barrage of missiles. One lucky hit later, the Blood was a cripple on the ground. The command lance was able to fight its way clear to the DropShip, but there was no way off the planet. Late that afternoon, Cassion’s Commandos and the DropShip Bolan’s Blood surrendered to Colonel Yetti and the battered 751st Jump Regiment.</Description>

    <Description>[3051] Clan Nova Cat landed on Avon in December 3051. The Second Amphigean Light Assault Group had been split into task forces to deal with the Clan invaders, but the Second knew they had only a slim chance of surviving against the 274th Battle and 449th Assault Clusters. The Nova Cats� initial assault immediately routed the Second from its positions. The Clans heavy elements pursued the defending forces while the light elements outflanked them.&#xD; After hard fighting, the Second broke through a weak spot in the Nova Cat lines and headed east toward a supply cache, but arrived to find Clan Elementals guarding the much-needed material. The Cats again forced the Second to move east, which allowed the defending troops to rejoin the rest of their regiment. The battle lasted less than a day because the Cat forces never allowed the Second a chance to dig-in. The Second made its final stand at Fresno, where the massed firepower of the Nova Cats decimated the Second's meager remaining troops.&#xD; [3059] Though limited in scale, the formal contest against the Nova Cats on Avon was one of the most violent engagements between the DCMS and Nova Cat forces. Avon was a front-line world, and Nova Cat honor demanded a true battle, no matter how heavily the Cats stacked the deck against themselves.&#xD; The Nova Cat leadership on Avon decided to fight the battle as a series of Clan-Style Trials of Position, with Kurita forces acting as the Challenge Group for each. Because Star Colonels and Star Captains would be doing the fighting, the Clan would have to defeat all Kurita challengers to retain autonomy. If defeated, the Nova Cat forces would be absorbed into the Draconis Combine and re-deployed as SLDF units. When the Kuritan High Command then offered to pit regular warriors against the Nova Cat elite, the Clan officers intentionally bid themselves down to lesser 'Mechs or 'Mechs with a slight design flaw that the Kurita forces could exploit.&#xD; In the ensuing Trials, the Nova Cats crippled three of more SLDF 'Mechs in each Trial, and were hard pressed to find a way to lose the battle. In the first Trial, the First Nova Cat Guards crippled five SLDF machines, and only managed to "lose" the engagement because Star Colonel Kalvin Rosse turned on his partner and crippled her 'Mech before being brought down by the remaining Forth Pesht Warrior. The rules of the melee allow such actions, giving the Star Colonel four "kills" in keeping with his rank. Following the battle of Avon, the Nova Cat Clusters became the SLDF Nova Cats and assisted in a major battle against Clan Smoke Jaguar in the invasion's second wave.</Description>

    <Description>Most of Axton is a polar wasteland, though many people praise the skiing to be found there. Volcanic activity warms the oceans, making the coastal areas habitable. The oceans are deep blue and the beaches are blacker than night on a moonless world.&#xD; Barros is the capital of Axton.&#xD; [3028] During the Forth Succession War documents captured from a "secret" NAIS research facility on Axton led the Capellan Confederation to believing in the existence of recent advances in myomer technology at a hidden NAIS outpost on the world of Bethel. In reality, the documents were part of an elaborate plan to let the Confederation gain access to the flawed triple-strength myomer technology.&#xD; [3067] When the Star League came tumbling down, Wangker Aerospace was building more than a dozen different kinds of aerospace fighters in its factories on five different worlds in the Terran Hegemony and Federated Suns. Those factories all became targets during the First Succession War, however, reducing Wangker Aerospace to almost nothing. In desperation, the company sent technicians and specialized reclamation teams to the ruins of its factories to strip what surviving equipment they could salvage before they were completely picked over. Hauling everything to back to Topell on Axton, the company rebuilt as best as it could and was once again assembling aerospace fighters by the middle of the Second Succession War, albeit at a much reduced capacity. The Capellan Confederation continued to hammer away at Axton throughout the Second and Third Succession Wars, but never again managed to completely knock Wangker Aerospace out of the fight.&#xD; That is not to say that the company didn�t suffer massive and lasting damage. The formation of the NAIS was a godsend to the Federated Suns� military industry. Wangker, like many of its competitors, was on the verge of collapse when the secrets of LosTech began to be rediscovered. Serious overhauls during the 3020s and 3030s brought Wangker�s Axton plants fully back online and gave the company the ability to produce fighters with select bits of rediscovered technology. Still, while orders for essentially the same fighters it has produced for the past several centuries have not slowed, the company is expanding its factories, hoping to diversify, even while its engineering teams are working on doing more than tweaking its current production models.</Description>

The Capellan military�s Bureaucratic and Logistical Offices were located on Azha in support of the Tikonov and Sarna Commonalities. &#xD;&#xD;Azha�s dry atmosphere means that it borders on being a desert world, yet it has enough arable landmass to support its current population. Far from being an agricultural world, Azha is able to produce the necessary raw materials for producing microchips for electronic and computer components. Azha has three continents that cover more than 50 percent of the planet. &#xD;&#xD;Castellan, the main continent, is the largest of the three. The one distinctive feature of Castellan is its lack of mountains. Located on the southwest coast of Castellan is the planetary capital, Casella. Nestled in the surrounding flatlands and rolling hills, Casella had some of the largest supply depots in Capellan space. Located in the southern hemisphere, the continent of Brasilia is home to the planet�s lone major source of food; its climate is cool and moist enough to support food production. Ortega is the smallest of the continents and is the most underdeveloped. &#xD;&#xD;During the 2351�2352 Tikonov-Sarna War, such savagery was committed on Ortega that no one ever ventured back to the continent, giving rise to rumors of ghosts and hauntings are told even today.</Description>

    <Description>[3059] In a district known for proud and devoted service, the loyalty of the Nineteenth Galedon Regulars has remained doubtful more often than not since the unit's inception. Formed during the long-drawn out Second Succession War in response to the DCMS's insatiable need for troops, the original Nineteenth was largely comprised of soldiers of questionable loyalty; however, the High Command determined that the need for more men outweighed the potential risk. The Nineteenth Galedon replaced other forces serving as planetary garrisons along the Periphery, freeing these more reliable units for more important duties.&#xD; Nowadays the Nineteenth Galedon rarely sees significant action; for more than thirty-five years the unit has garrisoned the planet Bad News, where occasional bandit raiders are the only enemy the unit regularly faces.&#xD; However, recently uncovered evidence suggests the Nineteenth Galedon may be financing its own operations into the Periphery, hunting down bandits and occasionally raiding planets near the Outworlds Alliance. Apparently, the unit keeps these activities at a low enough level to draw little attention and takes care not to leave evidence linking the attacks to Combine forces. The Nineteenth allegedly uses mercenary JumpShips for transportation, commanded by captains whose loyalty can be bought. Missing forces from the Nineteenth are consistently said to be "on extended maneuvers," but little other information is available.&#xD; The Warlord of Galedon may be allowing this state of affairs to continue because it keeps a potentially troublesome force occupied and allows the unit's warriors to maintain their level of expertise. Coordinator Theodore Kurita has declined to order an end to the alleged activities until clear evidence shows that the raids are taking place and damaging the Combine in some way.</Description>

Fight as they might, the defenders slowly lost control of the planet while the Draconis forces destroyed every building, shot every farm animal, burned all the crops.&#xD; After receiving news that the Commander of the Combat Region has been killed on Clovis, Colonel Barlow's superior gave the ROW (Retreat Off-World) order. Colonel Barlow refused to abandon his homeworld. His commanding officer said this would be folly, and so all the AFFS Dropships left Cussar. Nearly all of Barlow's battalion remained behind. &#xD; Barlow led his battalion into the mountains circling the planet's three major cities. For the next three years, his 'Mechs attacked and harassed the Kurita forces, and Barlow's forces managed to scavenge enough parts and supplies to keep their machines up and attacking. When their 'Mechs could no longer stand, Barlow and his men took up rifles and fought on for another ten years.&#xD; After almost 14 years of struggle in which Barlow's men had killed countless Kurita soldiers and destroyed tons of enemy equipment and supplies, the Kurita garrison on Cussar finally killed the last of the guerrilla forces. To their dismay, however, the Kuritans found that the bravery of Barlow's battalion had renewed the spirit of rebellion among the citizens of Cussar. Numerous new guerrilla actions were conducted in the name of Colonel Barlow. It had been difficult enough to battle a clever enemy hidden within the mountains, now the Kuritans faced enemies hidden within every civilian crowd.&#xD; To this day, Colonel Barlow is remembered on Cussar. As the civilian population is still rebellious, three times the normal number of Draconis troops are stationed there to prevent all-out revolt. Soldiers dread being assigned to this planet because of the constant terrorism being aimed at them.&#xD; Even the planet's name has changed. As the tales of Colonel Barlow's bravery spread throughout the Inner Sphere, people began to call Cussar "Barlow's Folly." The Draconis Combine itself has bowed to convention and now identifies Cussar by its new name.</Description>

Arid deserts cover the remainder of the planet.&#xD; Barras, a former Free Worlds League planet, was successfully occupied by the Confederation in 2521. In accordance with the Buenos Aires Convention of 2858, it became a neutral world to be used as a free port of call by both Houses Liao and Marik.  As such, it is a major exception to otherwise stringent trade restrictions levied by House Liao against the Free Worlds League in the early 29th century.  Despite this, Sian Commonality reserve regiment and an AeroSpace reserve contingent are permanently stationed on Barras to enforce Capellan claims to ownership.  Barras contains one of the highest concentrations of Maskirovka covert intelligence operatives of any world along the Capellan-Marik border.  An equal number of Marik secret service operatives, as well as other intelligence representatives from the Inner Sphere, can be found on Barras at any given time.  The planet is a logical jumping off point for clandestine operations of all kinds on all sides.</Description>

Despite these drawbacks, Basalt is rich in rare minerals and was one of the first planets settled by Terran mining companies. At the end of the First Star League, the Federated Suns laid claim to Basalt and held on to the world despite repeated Capellan raids through the early Succession Wars. &#xD; During the Forth Succession War, as part of the Capellan Confederation�s Operation Riposte, Liao sent a strike force to Basalt, to destroy warehouses storing vital supplies for the Davion offensive. In fact, the whole planet was an elaborate trap; Davion agents had leaked false intelligence to the Capellan Maskirovka. The warehouses were empty, and the elite 4th Davion Guards RCT was waiting to ambush the Capellan units. Today, the mountains around Lake Zander and the Contrassa spaceport, both on Basalt�s southern continent of Garnet, are littered with the remains of Liao BattleMechs.&#xD; The five continents of Amethyst, Garnet, Opal, Topaz, and Quartz, are almost all situated along the equatorial region of Basalt.

Headquartered in the city of Jupalpur, the company has mining operations in scores of systems throughout the Federated Suns and Periphery, and it maintains a handful of processing facilities, both landbased and space-based, which refine the raw ores. While the company supplies common ores, such as iron and aluminum, it focuses its efforts on rare resources, like germanium, uranium, titanium, and the like, as well as valuable metals and gemstones; if large deposits of other metals are discovered, they pursue those finds. The company formed Basantapur Petroleum to pursue discoveries of oils, coals, and other natural fuels.&#xD; The company experienced several decades of poor management in the early part of this century, bad enough that the Federated Suns government seriously considered stepping in and nationalizing it. After giving the company one final chance in 3026, Prince Hanse Davion appointed an independent group of executives to oversee an internal reorganization. Within five years, profits were greater than they had ever been, and the company was continuously growing. By the end of the decade, it had outright purchased its own transportation company and was rapidly expanding. Today, it supplies every major corporation in the Federated Suns, and still many within the Lyran Alliance and Free Worlds League, with its goods and continues to expand both its customer base and its resource base.</Description>

The Wolf commander masterfully kept the defenders off guard with small, probing attacks that made it impossible for �verste Fraga to keep track of all the units of Trinaries Command, Elemental, and fighter (of the Seventh Battle Cluster). Galaxy Commander Furey personally led the Bronze Keshik through rugged terrain on the Kavalleri�s flank to fall on the enemy�s rear.

These factors contribute to Baxley being one of the poorest and most ignorant of worlds in the Federated Suns.  Because of the poverty and lack of educational resources on Baxley, the inhabitants treat ComStar representatives like demi-gods. Their reverence is so great that the weekly observances and classes at our station enjoy a better turnout than does the local New Avalon Catholic Church. It is not surprising then that this impoverished world provides more aspirants to our Sacred Order than any other in Davion space.</Description>

    <Description>Baxter IV, the only inhabitable world in its system, is a world in turmoil. Due to an apparent near miss with a comet or rogue asteroid, the orbital path of Baxter's large moon, T'Laus, has gradually grown increasingly erratic in the centuries since the first settlers came to this world. Gravitational forces have played havoc on the surface of the world below, with frequent earthquakes, powerful dust storms, and rockslides an almost daily occurrence. &#xD; This shifting climate gradually turned a once-bountiful agricultural world into a giant, desolate wasteland, and is especially hard on machinery, which is constantly rocked or choked by dust. The descendants of the settlers who elected to remain today live in low structures or modified caves carved into the sides of the planet's many mountains and canyons, though legends today tell of a few cities that moved completely underground, only to be ripped asunder by the moon's tidal force.&#xD; Despite the inhospitable environment, however, life has continued on this world, maintained by an economy almost entirely based on its fishing exports. Though some common industrial metals are readily accessible on the planet, there are not sufficient quantities or concentrations of these resources to support a more than sustenance-level industry, and for this reason Baxter was largely overlooked throughout its history. Scientists, however, believe that better days will one day return to Baxter IV, as the orbit of T�Laus is expected to eventually re-stabilize. However, planetologists on Baxter appear to be uncertain as to whether such realignment is already underway, or if the moon has a few hundred more erratic orbits left to make before then.&#xD; The capital city and primary spaceport of Baxter, Cleopolis, is located on the northern continent of Atropia. Though surrounded by a cluster of smaller cities and towns, the equatorial and southern continents of Delgado and Hermathia are more evenly populated than the Cleopolis region, thanks to fewer large mountain chains and fault lines on these two landmasses.</Description>

Demanding the immediate transfer of Chesterton as well as Bell and Highspire from the Sarns, Reynard threatened the use of atomic weapons to enforce his claims.&#xD; It is uncertain whether Reynard has actual possession of such weapos, and if he did, whether he intended to use them. The threat however, was enough to send shock and fear throughout the various capital worlds in the Capellan zone. While debates raged into the autumn, Reynard Davion occupied Bell in September of 2357, the local Sarna garrison being overwhelmed by sheer force of numbers.&#xD; When a combined Tikonov-Sarna-Capellan relief force arrived in January the following year, no sign of the Davon forces, the original Sarna garrison, or the civilian population was found. Though a three-month, planet-wide and later system-wide search was instituted, no clue to the whereabouts of the 15,000 inhabitants of Bell were ever uncovered by the Sarna government.&#xD; In actuality, the population was transported as slave labor to the Davion world of Tentativa. In 2360, a Taurian explorer, Tracy Ashton Pendleton, accidentally discovered the missing Bellites while on a mapping/geology survey in the Tentativa system. Acting on her own initiative, Pendleton organized a revolt of the captive workers, who quickly overpowered the Davion garrison there.

Among the worlds in and around the Golden Five-the planets New Avalon, Galax, El Dorado, Belladonna and Torrence - it often seems that the glory days of the Star League never left. This is misleading. The Star League did fall and these worlds, though still impressive with their high-tech items and pristine cities, are only just rediscovering and learning to use technology of the 25th century. &#xD; Nevertheless, the Golden Five are worlds where even the lowliest citizen can expect sufficient food and a warm, dry place to sleep. Items like holosystems and remote communication devices are considered essential for the average middle-class family.&#xD; Cal-Boeing of Dorwinion is a small company made up of engineers and designers who left Federated-Boeing in 2899 over a disagreement about whether the company should expand into new areas of weapons design. The parting was amiable, however, and so Federated-Boeing donated a group of long-empty warehouses on the planet Belladonna to their former employees.&#xD; The new Cal-Boeing produced its first Ferret in 2901 and won an AFFS contract to build 6,000 of the light scout VTOL. Surprised by their good fortune, Cal-Boeing paid back Federated-Boeing to avoid any nasty takeover attempts on their part, then proceeded to expand their facilities to cope with the sudden demand. For 40 years, the company was so busy with the demand for Ferrets that they could not stop to design any other aircraft.&#xD; In 2967, Cal-Boeing finally came out with the Wild Weasel, a combat version of the Ferret. The design did not sell, however, except to Periphery kingdoms. Stung by the poor showing of the Wild Weasel, Cal-Boeing did not produce another new design until 3021. This was the Marten, another VTOL scout but with a wiser selection of weapons.&#xD;&#xD; [3054] Cal-Boeing's current COE, Count Douglas Fassei, is a firm believer in the combat value of his VTOL's. In a statement declaring that, "Only one who has the utmost confidence in his product deserves the patronage of his customers," the count announced that he would no longer require the services of the AFFC. A battalion of his Wild Weasel and Marten VTOL's would henceforth defend his factories.&#xD; As Belladonna is located deep within the Commonwealth, any raid here is highly unlikely. In fact, many skeptics believe the count's proclamation to be nothing more than a publicity stunt. It is clear that the dainty defenders will not pose much of a threat to any aggressors reaching this planet.</Description>

The Narhal Raiders squared off against the invaders but were swiftly outgunned and outmaneuvered. After losing more than two-thirds of their troops in four hours of battle, the Raiders abandoned Benfled. Seeing no apparent opposition, the Vipers declared that the world was now in their hands.&#xD; At that point, the Vipers received a broadcast from a headstrong young man named Rene Duchesne, a cadet officer in the Benfled Tenth Cadet Cadre. Duchesne informed the Vipers that the planet was not yet theirs and that the Cadet Corps wished tto bid in Clan fashion for the battle. Seeing no reason to refuse, Viper commanders agreed to the bidding. The two parties bargained for hours, until both sides had reduced their committed forces to a single unarmed and unarmored warrior. Then Duchesne brought forth his defending force - cadet Tony Bernson. Bernson was six feet, eight inches tall and almost 250 pounds of solid muscle. The cadet's size failed to daunt the Viper warrior, Star Commander Janine. The two combatants squared off and fought a quick, brutal battle that earned a mention in the Steel Viper Rememberance. Despite the cadet's respectable showing, Star Commander Janine emerged victorious and the Viper force took both Bernson and Duchesne as bondsmen.</Description>

    <Description>Benjamin is a large world orbiting a very dim sun.  To help boost the amount of sunlight the planet receives, it has sent 20 huge "semi-suns" into orbit around itself.  Much like the collecting sails of JumpShips, these semi-suns are circular reflectors made of paper-thin, mirror-like fabric.  The semi-suns reflect light down onto the planet in such a way that Benjamin's day is effectively lengthened and the amount of sunlight received is boosted by 20 percent.&#xD; Benjamin has a fair climate that can support hardier crops and meat animals, and has a few good deposits of petroleum and coal. The use of these fuel sources has polluted large stretches of the planet, but most of the industries now use the proper anti-pollution devices. The major heavy industry of Benjamin is parts manufacture for wheeled vehicles.&#xD; Benjamin's main importance arises from the fact that it is the capital of a military and political district.  The capital of Benjamin is Deber City, site of the huge Political Park of administrative buildings where the fate of billions is determined. Just outside the city is the headquarters of Warlord Hirushi Shotugama, the most powerful man in the district as well as the personal commander of the 17th Benjamin Regulars.&#xD; Located on Benjamin, Osaka Fields is one of the largest 'Mech proving grounds in the Draconis Combine. Traditionally, Benjamin's garrison maintains and administers Osaka Fields: in the absence of a regular DCMS unit on Benjamin, the planetary militia assumes those duties. Scattered throughout the Combine, proving grounds offer citizens of low birth or low academic standing an avenue to develop and exhibit the skills needed to enter the DCMS. The ISF maintains operatives at all proving grounds to scrutinize promising candidates for correct doctrine and loyalty to the Combine. Candidates approved by the ISF (or who produce an appropriate bribe) generally receive invitations to study at military academies, though exceptionally talented candidates may receive only a minimum of training and indoctrination before entering the ranks of the DCMS.&#xD; Osaka Fields consist of a large, untamed wilderness area that borders a military base abandoned when the current base was built. Only sensor relays define the practice fields, and so every warrior who uses the proving grounds must demonstrate perfect knowledge of the field boundaries. Because violating a boundary may put a BattleMech rigged for dummy-fire battle into a live-fire range, any warrior who violates a boundary immediately loses his or her field privileges.&#xD; Simulator time is reasonably priced, though regular military users always receive precedence over non-military users. Anyone with their own BattleMech may use the fields, and free-for-all matches are quite common. Previous administrations accepted random participants in groups of four or eight, scrambled them into roughly even teams based on their experience levels and sent them to their assigned fields. The current administration, however, often employs practises designed to make the sessions more productive for everyone involved. For example, the administration frequently combines opponents into unmatched groups and may incorporate specific goals unrelated to direct combat in to the victory conditions of each match.&#xD; A low-orbit satellite monitors the action on each field and sends trideo feeds to the field base. Anyone can purchase recordings of matches. The Osaka Fields offer entertainment that bears close resemblance to the games on Solaris, but the DCMS uses stiff fines to enforce the strict prohibition on wagering at the proving ground.</Description>

So close to Sian, the Fifth expected another counter-blow and were mildly surprised when none arrived. A single week on-world transformed into a six-week occupation as the Defenders sought to provoke a Capellan response, but to no avail. &#xD; Shortly after the regiment departed on 2 March the reason for the silence became deadly clear, in the form of a massive counter-attack.</Description>

    <Description>[3039] Situated along the anti-spinward edge of the Galedon Thrust, Bergman�s Planet, along with Harrow�s Sun and New Aberdeen, was chosen as a target for invasion during the first wave of the War of 3039. Primarily targeted in an attempt to draw off forces that might otherwise participate in the defense of the Galedon Military District, it was well known that there was a vocal anti-Combine movement on-world as the Combine had only just taken the world in the Fourth Succession War.&#xD; It wasn�t until AFFS special forces personnel arrived on Bergman�s Planet, however, that they realized that the resistance could call upon several thousand armed underground militiamen. Almost all had at least rudimentary training, thanks in part to a widespread interest in CombatMan, a �game� that allows anyone interested to take part in realistic combat with simulated weapons. Additionally, some �old-timers� were AFFS veterans and had passed on valuable knowledge to younger militiamen. The special forces personnel had only to provide some guidance and specifically plan out their strikes.&#xD; Lindon�s Battalion landed on 10 March to a virtual parade in the city of New Palermo. The resistance had already made its move and toppled the Combine governor. Likewise, special forces attacks crippled the planetary militia, allowing the insurgents to easily take control of the world. Lindon�s Battalion deployed to quickly crush what pro-Combine forces took to the field, completing the �conquest� of Bergman�s Planet by 16 March. Ironically, though it was the first world to fall in the War of 3039, it was one of the last that the DCMS High Command learned of, due entirely to the world�s wholly pro-Davion (or at least anti-Kurita) bent.&#xD; Tai-shu Kester Hsiun Chi ordered a reconnaissance force from the Twenty-First Galedon Regulars to the world, after regular communications with the world stopped. That force landed on 8 August and immediately reported the presence of mercenary forces and a strong insurgent underground, triggered the mobilization of the rest of the Twenty-First Regulars. In the meantime, the Galedon Regulars reconnaissance force and Lindon�s Battalion fought a campaign of raids and light engagement, always remaining on the move and never committing full-force to a single battle. &#xD; When the rest of the regiment arrived on 5 September, however, the nature of the fight changed significantly. Tai-sa Rai Githor approached the problem of a planet full of insurgents supported by mercenary BattleMechs with a heavy hand and an extremely proactive strategy. He first took command of the world�s capital city, flooding New Palermo with BattleMechs, infantry and armor, installing a new planetary governor before literally conducting a door-to-door search of every building within the city. He took a significant number of prisoners from just New Palermo alone, but during the next several weeks, he took thousands more as his troops scoured the world. Lindon�s Battalion did what they could to stop the Galedon Regulars, but at best they picked off small units that had become separated from the main body.&#xD; The mercenaries did attempt one massive assault, targeting the makeshift interment camps holding the political prisoners. They hoped that by freeing the prisoners they could rally the world�s people behind them. Of course, the mercenaries also realized that it could be a trap�which it was. The Galedon Regulars savaged Lindon�s Battalion, and though special forces teams managed to free some 2,500 prisoners from one camp, the teams � along with some 300 armed civilians � were cut down and every single prisoner was returned within a week�s time.&#xD; Lindon�s Battalion pulled off of the world shortly thereafter, ceding Bergman�s Planet to the superior Combine forces.</Description>

The Fifth Davion Guards RCT took up positions amid the sand dunes of Sirocco's Den, ready to defend both the capital city of Lothas and the important mining and industrial center of Cintosh. IlKhan Ulric Kerensky took advantage of the Guards' divided attention by landing the Golden Keshik and Alpha Galaxy away from defenders and feinting thrusts at both targets while moving to within combat range. &#xD; The ilKhan continued to move on both cities, increasing the ferocity of each attack. The command staff of the Davion Guards fell into what an engineer would describe as a "destructive harmonic cycle." They found themselves attempting to block enemy attacks first against one city, then the other. They tried to break the cycle and second-guess the ilKhan by sending reinforcements to Cintosh, only to have their forces around Lothas overwhelmed by the Wolves. The losses at Lothas were so heavy that Hauptmann General William Galloway retreated offworld to La Grave. The Fifth Davion Guards would eventually face Clan Jade Falcon and use what they had learned from their battles with Clan Wolf.&#xD; [3065] During the Falcon Incursion, Khan Vladimir Ward�s Wolves attempted to make inroads into the Falcon�s Occupation Zone. Unlike the Coventry Campaign of seven years previously, Khan Marthe Pryde was ready for a Wolf attack into her OZ and had troops in reserve, which she then sent to counterattack the Wolves in their own territory. &#xD; Elements of the 12th Falcon Regulars, 124th Striker and Jade Falcon Eyrie Clusters, landed on Bessarabia during March 3065, forcing the defending 1st Wolf Garrison Cluster to withdraw, whilst suffering moderate to serious damage themselves.</Description>

The tank company fought hardest, destroying three OmniMechs before the Falcons crushed the resistance. The battle-armored Elementals caused the infantry to break ranks and run. Some infantrymen turned guerrilla, but most faded back into the anonymity of civilian life.&#xD; [3064] During the Jade Falcon Incursion, General Anne Sung's Second Crucis Lancers set off on their own in wave 6, hitting the world of Beta VII on the 2nd of October 3064.

    <Description>[3039] Neither Colonel Archibald McCarron nor his regimental commanders found much comfort in the post-Fourth Succession War era. The Chancellor was becoming more and more paranoid. They welcomed any hope of battle, for they knew that would at least keep the Chancellor and her evil eye from targeting them as she had struck out at so many of her other military leaders.&#xD; Archie McCarron was surprised when three CCAF senior colonels visited him on Menke in May of 3039, and all but stunned when they suggested he undertake an operation of such magnitude into the Federated Suns. But as he looked over the intelligence reports that they had brought with them, McCarron was quickly won over. This was by no means a full-fledged invasion, however; the CCAF was still far too weak to even consider such a possibility. &#xD; In fact, more than anything, this was designed to be more of a morale-building exercise. The CCAF had just recently driven the Canopians from their nation, but that victory was tempered by the fact that it took five years of military action to do so. What the CCAF needed was a true victory, one that was unmistakable and could proclaim to the entire Human Sphere that the Confederation was once again a military power, and who better to target than the mighty Federated Suns.&#xD; Bethel was the third world targeted by Colonel Archie McCarron�s incursion. Like many of the other worlds struck by the Big Mac, Bethel was a world of little note � except, of course, for the role it played in the downfall of the Capellan Confederation in the Fourth Succession War. Supposedly home to a �secret� research facility that had developed the so-called Triple Strength Myomer, the Confederation struck Bethel and stole the technology that ultimately led to the CCAF�s failure on their capital world of Sian. &#xD; The First MAC, the Nightriders, descended on Bethel on the evening of 30 July, just as their name suggests. They struck out immediately, taking command of the world�s capital city that same night. The world�s militia began mobilizing immediately and attempted to drive the mercenaries from the city the next day, but they didn�t have nearly enough strength to do so. Worse still, the Nightriders allowed the fight to spread to the streets of Bethel City. The battle that day killed more than four hundred and set fires that burned for days longer, displacing tens of thousands in the process. &#xD; The militia was still attempting to mobilize its entire number, but the Nightriders seemingly controlled the skies and had a complete freedom of movement on the ground. They struck every major city on the planet, inflicting as much damage as they could. Thousands more died during these assaults, and though Nightrider officers would later claim that they were not specifically targeting the civilian inhabitants of the world, it was obvious that they were attacking objectives of dubious military value.&#xD; By the end of their eight days on Bethel, twelve major cities were either in flames or just beginning the damage assessment process, the militia had been rendered neutral by either the destruction or scattering of component units, and the world�s power grid was on the verge of collapse. The Nightriders left Bethel behind, having taken nothing and delivered only death and destruction, on the morning of 7 August.</Description>

Along the seacoast, there are fat but graceful land/sea mammals that seem to disappear without a trace at the first scent of humans. In addition, there is a small mushroom-like plant that can uproot itself to move to more fertile ground or to avoid danger. All of these lifeforms are adept at avoiding traps, and all of them are delicious.&#xD; With the signing of the Star League Accords in 2569, the Terran Hegemony, and Terra in particular, became an important center of activity. Naturally, the Court of the Star League in Unity City was the prime focus.&#xD; To show the united nature of the League, the interior of the court was built with materials from every corner of human space. From Bharat, teakwood was carved by artisans and encrusted with gems.&#xD; Apart from its rare-wood exports, attempts to industrialize Bharat mostly failed.

Killosh eventually retooled to produce logging equipment and vehicles for Bharat's lumber companies.&#xD; After the fall of the First Star League, the Capellan Confederation claimed Bharat. With no industrial resources, Bharat stayed untouched through most of the Succession Wars, and Capellans vacationed on Bharat to hunt the planet's unusual and delicious reptiles, sea mammals, and mobile fungi. The Federated Suns took Bharat from the Capellan Confederation with little bloodshed in the Fourth Succession War, and Bharat enjoyed continued prosperity during the Second Star League.&#xD; The southern continent of Vidya is home to the capital of Chakra.

    <Description>[3048] The Kensai Kami training program pits the best MechWarriors currently serving in the DCMS against instructors and one another in an effort to push the elite to greater heights of skill. A sort of year-round "masters program" for the Combine's best MechWarriors, the Kensai Kami graduates a class every three months. Only the most talented MechWarriors in a given regiment receive the honor of undergoing this training.&#xD; Before the Forth Succession War, the graduating classes of various Draconis Combine academies and universities tested themselves against each other in the team-play atmosphere provided by the Kensai Kami program. Sun Zhang Academy graduates ruled the program in the earliest days, though they occasionally received stiff competition from graduates of An Ting University and the University of Proserpina. Eventually the DCMS decided that the resources it devoted to the program were needed more urgently elsewhere. With the onset of the Forth Succession War, the Ronin War, and later the War of 3039. In 3048, Kanrei Theodore Kurita resurrected the Kensai Kami on the planet Bicester as a way to offer advanced training to the DCMS MechWarriors.&#xD; Every regiment in the DCMS is allowed - and in the case of celebrated regiments, expected - to send one warrior of Sho-sa rank or below to each Kensai Kami course. The Kensai Kami runs on a quarterly schedule. During the three-month course, warriors fight a series of simulator and dummy-fire battles against elite instructors and, at regular intervals, against each other. These competitions range from one-on-one battles to lance engagements, and often pit students against uneven odds. The instructors evaluate each warrior on personal tactics and ability and also judge each warrior's skill in leading multiple-warrior engagements.&#xD; The Kensai Kami program runs its participants through a wide variety of missions, from defense duty to search-and-destroy scenarios. The mission goal and battle parameters frequently change mid-scenario, always to the disadvantage of the program participants. The administrators vary the content of the program each quarter, thus eliminating any advantage studying the current program. Warriors participate in seventy-five missions worth up to forty points each during the twelve-week Kensai Kami course. The length of each mission varies from a few hours to several days.&#xD; A warrior must earn at least 750 points to participate in the Kensai Kami graduation ceremony. While achieving only 25% of the possible total score is considered unacceptable in most programs, such a score in Kensai Kami means only that the warrior belongs to the lower ranks of the most elite soldiers in the most proficient military in the Inner Sphere. A Score of 1000 - 1500 points defines the average, and any score above 2000 is considered an Honors score. The warrior with the highest total score in each quarterly program receives a promotion in rank and may choose to join the Kensai Kami as an instructor. If the warrior belongs to one of the more disreputable regiments in the DCMS, he or she may be awarded a transfer to a new unit.&#xD; Graduates of the program are award a ribbon which they may wear on their dress uniforms, and the top scorers of each program receive a medal from their district warlord, which they may also wear with their dress uniforms. In addition, Kensai Kami graduates may paint the red, black and gold bars of the Kensai Kami flag on the back of their 'Mechs.</Description>

The runaway mining, drilling, and petrochemical processing rapidly devastated what had proven to be an extremely fragile ecosystem. By the time the planetary government finally stepped in to regulate the industries, the damage was so extreme travelers were urged to stay clear of the planet for health considerations, and all material shipped off-world had to undergo decontamination at special orbital outposts. &#xD; Only Yoshimatsu Chemicals, one of the Draconis Combine's greatest chemical corporations, with its track record for rigorous safety procedures and strict clean-air guidelines, met the harsh restrictions suddenly imposed by the planetary government.

    <Description>[3052]Bjarred is a rather small world beneath a large hot sun.  Though it has little open water on its surface, huge underground rivers run through catacombs below the surface.  Lush grasses, bushes, and trees cluster above these subterranean waterways.  As a result, vast lines of vegetation crisscross the planet.  Bjarred's barren mountains are rich in minerals and metals, which attracted the first colonists, an Ozawa scout group, in the early 23rd century.&#xD; Today, the Deep Ores Company is the sole industry on the planet.  In contract with the Metals of the Earth, the Deep Ores Company has kept other companies away by frequently paying bribes to the planet's Chairman.  Because the Chairman has recently been demanding higher bribes, the CEO of Deep Ores, Melissa Ozawa (a distant relation of the famous Ozawas) has decided to stop paying.  She believes that her company is now strong enough to stand competition from any rival that appears on Bjarred.&#xD; Mountain bandits often raid Deep Ores' mines and camps.  Defending the planet and the mining concern is a battalion of the 4th Pesht Regulars commanded by Colonel Brethby Stiverson. Their headquarters are in the capital of Bjarred, Oasis V.&#xD; [3050] During the fighting with Clan Smoke Jaguar in March 3050, the defending First and Second Bjarred Armoured Regiments took refuge in the Bird's Roost, a crumbling Castle Brian. The Jaguar's hunted their prey through the castle's maze of tunnels, and Trinary Striker suffered severe casualties when part of the castle wall collapsed on top of it. The survivors of Trinary Striker, along with First Trinary Battle and Binary Elemental, of the Jaguar Grenadiers, eventually flushed out the defenders and destroyed them.&#xD; [3059] During Operation Bulldog, the possession of Bjarred was decided by the toss of a coin toss. In bidding to take the world single handedly, Tai-Sa Katherine Oltion of the Sixth Ghost Regiment, in the service of the SLDF, stated �in combat there are only two elements: skill and chance.�&#xD; Her opponent, Star Colonel Olivia Drummond of the Nova Cat 189th Striker Cluster, impressed with the Tai-Sa's bid, agreed that the part of skill had been cancelled out between them, leaving only chance. Tai-Sa Oltion then flipped a coin, leaving chance to decide the fate of the world. Star Colonel Drummond chose "edge", and lost, granting the Bjarred to the SLDF. The Nova Cat forces were taken as bondsmen, and then freed to defend the world in the name of the SLDF.</Description>

    <Description>[3050] Following their disastrous defeats on Barcelona and Bone Norman, the remnants of the Seventeenth Skye RCT and the First Grave Walkers regrouped on Black Earth. The Falcons hit Black Earth like a hurricane in May 3050, decimating the already battered defending forces. The Jade Falcon aerospace commander surprised the Seventeenth Skye RCT aerospace fighters on the ground, but allowed the pilots to scramble and mount a defense. The Seventeenth's fighters fought bravely, but the Falcons overpowered them. &#xD; The 'Mechs and tanks of the Seventeenth held off Gyrfalcon Galaxy for an hour at the spaceport before collapsing. The Grave Walkers attempted to use flaming oil from a New Houston refinery as a defensive barrier, but they learned, as the Fourteenth Legion of Vega learned battling clan Smoke Jaguar, that this tactic was useless against the Clans' superior technology. Within thirty hours of the initial assault, Clan Jade Falcon controlled Black Earth.&#xD; [3064] General Steiner began his assault on the Jade Falcon OZ with an attack upon Black Earth, jumping into the system using a pirate point on the 3rd October 3064. Leading a combined force consisting of elements of his own Fourteenth Donegal Guards, Colonel Blucher's Fifteenth Arcturan Guards (including elements of the Neerabup MTM and Gacrux FTM), and the Ninth Lyran Regulars, general Steiner dropped onto the world expecting a quick operation. Instead, the battle quickly became bogged down and turned into a three-week fight that saw the Third Talon Cluster make extensive use of heavy aerospace fighters against his units.&#xD; When General Steiner hadn't pacified the world by the 10th October, Khan Kell dispatched his First Wolf Strike Grenadiers to assist, arriving on the 17th. A week later General Steiner's force had taken the work and the second battalion of the Blue Star Irregulars' 1894th Striker arrived to help garrison the world while Steiner moved on.</Description>

The Blackjack School of Conflict was founded to tutor those who had failed the entrance exams at the other academies. If a student can afford to enroll in the Blackjack School, they will get an education similar to that of the other military schools. &#xD; In addition to those standard courses, Blackjack also offers unofficial courses that deal with the shadier side of military life. It is said the going to the Nagelring will ensure its graduates a glorious warrior's funeral,  but going to Blackjack will ensure graduates a long life and the ill-gotten wealth to enjoy it. Despite this, the Commonwealth has made no move to clean up the school, for the simple reason that its graduates are excellent soldiers.&#xD; In an attempt to improve corruption within the military, Archon Katrina Steiner has written a new course in Military Ethics, which is now required reading for every cadet in all Commonwealth military academies, except of course for the Blackjack School of Conflict.&#xD; [3050] Kommandant Dean Bristow's Blackjack training Battalion did not expect their first combat experience to be fighting Clan Jade Falcon. The outgunned and inexperienced battalion impressed the Clan warriors by fighting bravely and honorably. Despite suffering an 80% casualty rate, they mauled the Second Falcon Jaegers, and Cadet Mark Harris defeated a Clan OmniMech in an impromptu Trial of Possession for the cadet's family home. &#xD; The Jade Falcons allowed the battalion to evacuate the planet, though they took some cadets as bondsmen. Many Jade Falcon warriors considered these cadets the most honorable foes the Clans had met in the Inner Sphere, and one Star Colonel later said that the Inner Sphere cadets had passed their trial of Position. Three months after the battle at Tukayyid, Cadet Mark Harris was positively identified as a Star Commander in Gyrfalcon Galaxy. &#xD; Clan Steel Viper later occupied the planet in 3054, and their first act was to raze the Blackjack School of Conflict.</Description>

    <Description>Blair Atholl is a dreary world covered by constant drizzling rains. Troops squelch through a landscape blanketed by an enormous amount of fungi, varying in size and shape but uniformly drab in color.&#xD; [3055] Based on Blair Atholl, Clan Steel Viper's 1st Legion has fended off several probes by Federated Commonwealth forces. In 3055, the eleventh Avalon Hussars launched a major assault on the world, but the Vipers demonstrated their contempt for the Inner Sphere unit by sending only the 1st Legion to meet them. The veteran 1st repulsed the Hussars in short order.&#xD; [3057] The Kathil Uhlans fared better in 3057, when their Third Battalion raided the world. Thinking to repeat their victory over the Hussars, the 1st Legion moved to repel the invaders, but instead found themselves the victims. After felling a Trinary of Viper 'Mechs, the Uhlans withdrew. Reports from the Watch indicate that only the secession of the Lyran Alliance and the formation of the Arc-Royal Defense Cordon forestalled an assault by the entire Kathil Uhlans to destroy the Viper Cluster.&#xD; [3064] The Falcon's Ninth Provisional Garrison Cluster took up station on Blair Atholl before the Falcon Incursion even began. As the Incursion progressed, they remained ever-vigilant, ready to either defend the world, or to charge further into the Lyran Alliance to help exploit the gains of their brethren. ComStar's 388th Division landed on Blair Atholl on the 15th December 3064, putting paid to the Ninth's hopes of further conquest, though allowing them the glory of battle.&#xD; The Ninth PGC never allowed the Com Guards to seize the initiative, hounding them from the moment they landed on world. The single cluster, reinforced by several Trinaries pulled from nearby garrison units, drove the Com Guards ahead of them across two continents before seemingly running out of energy.&#xD; Shortly afterward Khan Marthe Pryde led her Turkina Keshik to the world, landing on the 20th February 3065. Khan Phelan Kell reached the world on the 24th. SaKhan Clees made landfall on the 26th while General Adam Steiner, accompanied by Christifori, grounded on the 27th.&#xD; Khan Pryde and General Steiner called a general cease fire within their respective regions and eventually agreed on a plan that would end the Falcon Incursion. The world of Blair Atholl would remain jointly-held by the Falcons and the LAAF as something of a live-fire training world, giving the Falcons a place where they could send their warriors to gain real combat experience. Though that agreement would mean that the LAAF troops on-world would constantly be threatened by the Jade Falcons, the world would at least remain something of a controlled environment.</Description>

While dozens of colony ships made the trek to and from the new world, military transports secretly built a logistics depot there, preparing for the invasion of the Federation. Surprisingly, though Federation President McIntyre knew an invasion of his nation was inevitable, none found out about the secret base on Valerius until VI Legio dropped onto Blantleff in January 3066. &#xD; Caesar Julius O'Reilly had intended to use more forces for this first wave, but was forces to use additional resources to put down small insurrections and apparent Pirate raids throughout his realm. Nevertheless, the first invasion wave was brilliantly executed, and Blantleff fell in mere weeks. It didn't hurt that the Circinians saw the Marian invaders as liberators as much as conquerors.&#xD; Federation forces disguised as elements of IV Legio attacked the unit on Blantleff in May 3066, though by this time the masquerade had been discovered. Still somewhat under-strength at the time, VI Legio counterattacked with a passion that surprised friend and foe alike. The Federation force disintegrated within two weeks.&#xD; VI Legio rebuilt with equipment captured from this enemy force and remains on guard - though a state of war still technically exists between the Marian Hegemony and the Circinus Federation - the fighting has been over for more than a year.</Description>

    <Description>The surface of Blue Hole is dotted with small clear-water ponds of surprising depth, and many of the pools are connected by deep channels.&#xD; During the Clan war, Inner Sphere 'Mechs used these terrain features to great effect, essentially evening-out the Clan 'Mechs heat-efficiency advantage. Enemy 'Mechs are often able to close to short range without being detected, a tactic which negates the Clans' weapon-range superiority.&#xD; [3064] During first wave of the Jade Falcon incursion of the Lyran Alliance, Blue Hole was attacked by the First Falcon Swoop Cluster, the Turkina Eyrie Cluster, and Galaxy Commander Timur Malthus' Sigma Galaxy Command. Blue Hole was a world already gripped by violence. After being forced off Kikuyu early in the Civil War, the remnants Eighth Deneb Light Cavalry retreated to Blue Hole. There they faced the Third Alliance Guards. Both sides believed they could easily crush the other, and so only both sides kept their distance, trading only long ranged shots. Several weeks later, Storm's Metal Thunder mercenary unit arrived to tip the balance in favor of the Loyalist forces. Colonel Jean-Henri de Jeruc, commander of the Eighth DLC, waged a mobile campaign for months, keeping both Loyalist units constantly off guard. Then the Falcons landed on 28th May 3064.&#xD; Galaxy Commander Malthus primarily watched from the sidelines as the First Swoop concentrated on Storm's Metal Thunder and the Turkina Eyrie took on the Third Alliance Guards. Colonel de Jeruc tried to assist where he could, but the Loyalist regiments not only refused his help, but actually fired on his troops. The Eighth DLC continued to operate on the move, keeping the Falcon troops off them.&#xD; The Alliance Guards and Storm's Metal Thunder did not learn from Colonel de Jurec's lead, though, and were punished heavily by the Clan troops. The Alliance Guards escaped Blue Hole with only four companies, though Storm's Metal Thunder managed to last for a while longer, giving time for reinforcements to arrive from Kikuyu. Approximately battalions worth of the Sixth Donegal Guards pulled of Kikuyu, under orders from General Sharon Bryan. The addition of the Sixth Donegal did little to save the situation though.&#xD; On the 15th June, the Seventh Talon Cluster landed, having followed the Sixth from Kikuyu. The Falcons first crushed the mercenaries - who escaped with only two operational 'Mechs, and then the Sixth Donegal, which was wiped out in late July. Khan Kell's First Wolf Legion reached the world on the 7th August, facing only the Seventh Talon - the other units having moved on with the Falcon incursion. The fresh Wolf Cluster eventually won the day, though the Eighth DLC was all but destroyed in the months of battling. By the end of August, Blue Hole was firmly in Allied hands.</Description>

    <Description>William Keller Reese, first Count of Bluford (2508-2594), is unique in the way he made his name and fortune. Reese, whose grandparents and great-grandparents all lived into their nineties, literally gambled his life to make his fortune - he entered tontines with smokers.&#xD; This is the way it worked. Several young people would pledge a certain sum of money per year as long as they lived, to be paid into a trust in all of their names. When only one of the individuals was left alive, he or she would receive the entire sum. Named after Lorenzo Tonti, a financier of 17th-century Terra, the tontine was originally an early form of insurance plan, intended to guarantee funds for a person's retirement years. By Reese's time, it was little more than a wager that one person would outlive another.&#xD; The soil of Bluford's smallest, eastern-most continent was, and is, ideally suited for growing a strain of tobacco developed in the 22nd century that was both deadlier and more addictive than any previous strain. Reese made sure that all of the other entrants in his many tontines were smokers. He was willing to take the calculated risk that he might meet an early death himself, and his gamble paid off. Although he was short-lived by the standards of his family, dying at the tender age of 86, he had, by age 75, amassed a fortune of over 70 million D-Bills. By age 81, a title of nobility was conferred upon Bluford for his monetary and political support of Davion entry into the Star League.&#xD; Reese's success touched off a flurry of gambling activities on Bluford, with tontines becoming enormously popular among smokers and nonsmokers alike. For a 22 year period in the early 27th century, the planetary government of Bluford even entered every baby born on any given day into a tontine, which was referred to as a "Life Lottery." A backlash began in the late 27th century, when problems with the system had become evident, and a movement to ban tontines developed. Although never successful, the movement did spawn the opposition Bluford Gambling Association, whose members protested any infringement on their rights to squander their money and gamble with their lives.&#xD; Between 2620 and 2840, Bluford had the highest annual murder rate of any planet in the Inner Sphere.</Description>

    <Description>[3025] Bolan is the site of the Lyran Commonwealth's regional Military Intelligence Center that scrutinizes the Free Worlds League.&#xD; [3053] The loss of the War College of Tamar to Clan Wolf reduced the Lyran output of ground forces by a quarter, a major blow given the immense losses suffered by the military. The short-term solution was to draw troops from militia units and to accelerate the programs of the three remaining ground-force academies. However, it soon became apparent that these efforts alone would not solve the problem and that more was needed to rebuild the armed forces.&#xD; Thus, in 3053 Archon Melissa Steiner-Davion authorized the upgrade of the Bolan militia training facility to academy status. The work was completed a year later, and the Bolan Martial Academy graduated its first line troops in mid-3055. The assassination of the Archon later that year shocked the academy staff. As a result, they petitioned the then-AFFC high command to rename the facility the Melissa Steiner Martial Academy, a more quickly agreed by Prince Victor.&#xD; So far, the academy teaches only "conventional" troops - infantry and armor - as well as technical support staff and specialists such as combat engineers and artillery. Plans to create a MechWarrior training academy on Bolan have repeatedly run into problems, principally with financing but also with bureaucratic delays and political objections. The heads of several other academies, jealous of their positions and viewing Bolan as an upstart, have enmeshed the process in red tape. As a result, the MechWarrior facility is not scheduled to begin training troops until 3065, ten years behind schedule. &#xD; Though newly come to its academy status, the MSMA has a long history of hard work graduating competent soldiers. Unfortunately, its former boot camp status has prompted many units to regard MSMA graduates as inferior to those of established facilities. The instructors and cadets work hard to overcome this prejudice, but the resistance has steadily sapped their resolve and a "why bother" malaise is beginning to take hold in some of the older instructors.&#xD; [3060] Though the last Jaeger unit to enter active service, the 1st Bolan Jaegers regiments has already demonstrated its skill and resolve during the Quetta Land War, a violent dispute between two cities on Bolan's Sak�t� continent. Simmering for more than a decade, the dispute centered on control of the Brahui Pass, a 100-kilometer-long gorge through the Kilimshan mountain range and a major artery for goods flowing to both cities. When Quetta attempted to take control of the pass, their neighbors in Sibi protested. At first their challenges kept to the courts, but then the situation worsened. Each city began menacing the other, first with hired thugs, then with scattered sniper attacks on convoys. In 3060 the situation exploded into open warfare and the newly operational Jaegers were sent to separate the two combatants.&#xD; Each protested its innocence and blamed the other for the fighting, but Colonel Lambert pursued a policy of strict neutrality, deftly avoiding their attempts to make her take sides and instead worked to separate the factions and ensure relief supplies flowed freely. The turning point in the dispute came several weeks after the regiment arrived, when a Jaeger-escorted convoy came under artillery attack while in the pass. More than a dozen civilians were killed. The Quetta Council immediately accused the Jaegers of standing by and allowing Sidi forces to massacre their people, demanding both restitution and LAAF support to crush their opponents.&#xD; Unfortunately for the Quetta, the Jaeger's fire-track radar systems showed clearly that the barrage originated from Quetta positions, seemingly an attempt by the Council to force the Jaegers to take their side. Lambert faced down the Council with the evidence, which they denied vehemently. However, within a week all Quetta claims to control of the pass were withdrawn. The combatants withdrew under LAAF supervision. A company of Jaegers remains in the area to ensure the situation's continued stability, but the bulk of the unit returned to the capital, Bolan City.</Description>

Because of this, Borghese�s population leveled off at the current level of only 10 million.&#xD; Borghese's inhabitants are mainly involved in the world's only industry, mermaid fishing. Though not actually mermaids, the name given by the early settler's has stuck and become official. Because of the storms, the fishing industry is limited to the waters nearest the land.

The remaining cities are mostly small towns or, more often, simply collections of families who happened to build near one another.&#xD; The land is able to support several hybrid Terran crops, mostly strains of beans, corn, and wheat, allowing limited livestock production.

Still the largest agricultural planet in the Alliance, with products ranging from a variety of native and transplanted grains to livestock, fish and caviar, this world has seen only a slight decline since the arrival of the Clans. &#xD; Not surprisingly, its abundance made Bountiful Harvest a real prize during the early years of the Lyran Commonwealth, and on a few occasions the Protectorate of Donegal and the Tamar Pact nearly went to war over ownership of this world. The Commonwealth government settled the dispute by opening Bountiful Harvest up to agro-corporations from all three member states. &#xD; In the centuries since, these three corporations have merged to form Bountiful Delicacies, the largest single agricorp on the planet, and arguably the Alliance's largest single supplier of everything from basic foodstuffs and military rations to gourmet foods such as White Hart truffles and Harvest Caviar. &#xD; Bountiful Delicacies' headquarters is located in the planetary capital of KevGlen City on the Grandeur continent, but has been facing stiff competition for centuries from Nashan Foods, a division of Nashan Diversified that also owns huge tracts of arable land on this planet.</Description>

Breed was a hotly contested world for its vast wealth in mineral and ore deposits. The system�s two asteroid belts are also rich in ore sources for the Federated Suns.&#xD; Breed is a medium sized world with a slightly higher gravity than most colonized worlds in the Inner Sphere. The majority of the planet is covered by very dense water, a phenomenon that took scientists more than a decade to solve before they could use the vast oceans to supply fresh water. Breed�s three continents, Talicar, Hindi and Trice, are island continents that have no natural land bridges to connect them. The planetary capital, Tonston, is located on Talicar and is home for each of the three major mining concerns based on the planet.</Description>

    <Description>Throughout humanity�s race to the stars, colonists relied upon hardy animals to provide food on worlds where the native fauna was unable to sustain their needs. The goat was just one of the many animals they commonly used. Once introduced into Brockway�s environment, the mountain goat grew even more useful. Thanks to feeding upon the local flora, the Brockway goat not only grew larger and stronger, but incredibly prolific. Kids mature faster and females produce more offspring with each birth than any Terran goats. Additionally, its coat of fur, though not particularly fast-growing, can be made into a useful textile. These facts alone make the Brockway goat attractive to colonists and ranchers alike, but it�s the creature�s horns, which typically reach more than a meter in length, that make the most significant impression on observers.&#xD; [2590] After the failure of General Forlough's 'scorched-earth' tactics on New Vandenburg, he was recalled to Terra in January 2590, to be replaced by Lord Damien Onaga.&#xD; With much of the Concordat's force withdrawn within the relative safety of Hyades Cluster, General Onaga led the Star League forces through the remainder of the outlying Concordat planets virtually unopposed.&#xD; Brockway was occupied in November 2590.&#xD; [3066] Expecting a Davion invasion of the Taurian Concordat which never came, the now paranoid Protector Shraplen ordered his own strikes deep into the Federated Suns.

Brockway fell to the Hyades Light Infantry without much of a struggle in late 3066.&#xD; Meant only to be punitive raids, these successes prompted further strikes with the Taurian regiments now believing they could reclaim their ancient homeworlds, and pay the Federated Suns back for their losses in the Reunification Wars.&#xD; By early 3067 however, and with the civil war coming to an end, Duke George Hasek was able to send a massive force of AFFS regulars and mercenary units to cut the Taurians off and repel them.</Description>

It told of chemical and metal resources, fertile soils, and deep seas. Many men and women, lured by the glowing reports, lined up to join expeditions to Bryant. What had gone unmentioned in the accounts was that Bryant had a harsh climate that lashed most of the planet's surface with storms and winds approaching 300 kilometers per hour. For the first two centuries, colonization was confined to the planet's polar regions, where the men and women lived a cold, quiet existence.&#xD; In 2478, the Terran Hegemony put the first Storm Inhibitor into geosynchronous orbit around Bryant. The Storm Inhibitor is a reflector that is aimed at clouds gathering above a planet's oceans. The concentrated heat on the clouds did not prevent storms but lessened their severity. The change in the weather soon allowed colonists to begin settling the temperate regions of the planet.&#xD; Once the colonists could begin farming the warmer lands, Bryant became an important agricultural center for the Hegemony. Many of the planet's indigenous lifeforms, such as the Crowley Lizard Cow and the Jewel Bass, became delicacies. Tourism became important to Bryant's economy because of the planet's many beaches.&#xD; Then came the forces of Stefan Amaris. Republican pilots used the Storm Inhibitors for target practice. The remaining Inhibitors became the final strongholds for the SLDF. The soldiers died like insects beneath a magnifying glass. With the Storm Inhibitors gone, the planet's climate has once again become stormy.&#xD; Then came the forces of Stefan Amaris. Republican pilots used the Storm Inhibitors for target practice.

With the Storm Inhibitors gone, the planet's climate has once again become stormy. Since then the planet's population has been moving back towards the poles because of the worsening weather, leaving behind them abandoned cities. &#xD; [3056] When Liao and Marik forces invaded the Sarna March, they bypassed Bryant for more tempting targets. Taking advantage of the breakdown of what little authority existed, a local warlord calling himself Viscount Dvensky has claimed Bryant as his personal fiefdom. Anticipating a Liao attack, the self-styled Viscount appealed to the Victor Steiner-Davion of the Federated Commonwealth for military support, but none was forthcoming. Dvensky has since declared Bryant independent, and apparently supports his government - such as it is - by sending bands of fighters loyal to him on supply raids against the nearby planets of New Home and Epsilon Indi. These so-called Bryant Regulars has been alarmingly successful, prompting calls for action against them from various quarters. According to rumor, Viscount Dvensky is secretly raising an army to capture Epsilon Indi or New Home, or possibly both. As yet, no one can confirm the truth of these rumors.&#xD; In the past few months, Bryant has attracted increasing numbers of explorers and treasure hunters searching for Star League relics that may still exist in the numerous abandoned cities across the planet.</Description>

It is covered with dense jungle, with the exception of its center: A large mountain mesa dominating the surrounding area rises up out of the jungle like a fortress nearly a thousand kilometers across. It was here that the planetary capital, Belgrade, was founded along with a large DropPort. &#xD; The planet's ocean was the reason the planet was settled. Fishermen from old Terra could only dream of enormous fish like the ones found on Buchlau. Some of the fish grew to the size of killer whales from Terra's oceans. As its importance grew, Buchlau started exporting to planets like Algol, Halloran V, and Demeter. During the Succession Wars, Buchlau never suffered attacks the way its neighbors did, as it lacked any strategic importance. That changed during the Fourth Succession War. Davion forces overwhelmed the Capellan defenders, taking the planet for their own. Not until the eruption and formation of the Chaos March did the Chancellor consider making any moves to recover the former Liao world. &#xD; During the FedCom Civil War, Chancellor Sun-Tzu Liao used his Maskirovka to stir up pro-Capellan sentiments.

The planetary garrison, a permanent Sian Commonality reserve regiment augmented by numerous local militia forces, signals Capellan  determination to hold onto the planet.&#xD; Recently, a large island in the eastern basin has been taken over for secret tests thought to involve the development of rotary anti-'Mech VTOLS.&#xD; From 2901 through 2910, elements of an elite strike force (code named "Red Rover") containing units of the Defenders of Andurien and the Orloff Grenadiers, conducted a series of deep penetration raids against key Liao supply depots at Aldebarran, Shensi and Nanking. The raid culminated in the daring capture of a fully laded iceship, the "Silver Frost," as it prepared to depart the Buenos Aires system. With the Silver Frost in tow, the Red Rovers launched a multi-pronged assault on the then Liao desert world of Zion, routing the defending garrison from its fortifications in the Gapston mountain range.&#xD; [3031] In addition to the Defenders of Andurien and her mercenary forces, Dame Humphreys also inherited several specialized FWLM units when Andurien seceded from the League � and began its joint invasion of the Capellan Confederation with the Magistracy of Canopus. Among these was one of the irregular �Liberation Units� whose personnel she unleashed on Shiba and Buenos Aires. Combining psychological warfare tactics with assassinations and sabotage, this small force quickly undermined the governments on both worlds and, having convinced the authorities that Sian had abandoned them, brought about their incorporation into Andurien.&#xD; [3034] Leo�s Demons and Barton�s Regiment assaulted Buenos Aries in June 3034. Unlike their sister regiment on Shiba, the Fifth Defenders of Andurien made little effort to escape and in fact seemed eager to face the McCarron�s force despite the long odds. The six-week battle that followed left the Fifth badly bloodied but seemed to restore their sense of pride after the disaster on Betelgeuse. When they finally broke contact and left Buenos Aires in mid-July, the mercenaries chose not to pursue.</Description>

    <Description>[3050] Leftenant General Davis Winfield knew that the incoming Falcon DropShips carried enough of the Forth Velites to outnumber his forces. Showing exceptional courage, which impressed the Jade Falcons, General Winfield countered the Falcon batchall by challenging Star Colonel Evak Mattlov of the Forth Velites to personal combat. Winfield had the upper hand until a lucky laser hit destroyed his Atlas� gyro. General Winfield�s enraged troops attacked the Velites� positions, and Winfield, knocked unconscious when his �Mech fell, could not order his troops to cease-fire. The Falcon Velites obliterated Winfield�s Regiment. When General Winfield awoke in a Jade Falcon hospital unit, he was saluted for his honor, and made bondsman to Clan Jade Falcon.&#xD; [3064] During the Jade Falcon Incursion, General Christifori entered the Butler system on the 17th of October 3064. Initially his ships came upon an Aegis class cruiser, the Black Talon. Fortunately for Christifori, the ship was undergoing repairs within an orbital dry-dock facility, and was disabled and captured with relative ease. On Butler itself, they faced just two trinaries of the Ninth Falcon Talon Cluster, plus a host of technical crews who did their best to swarm the general's 'Mechs and vehicles. Far outnumbering the defenders, Christifori's troops quickly pacified the world.&#xD; The world remained in Lyran hands until the final phase of the Incursion, after the Blair Atholl agreement had been reached. When elements of Clan Diamond shark had taken Twycross away from the LAAF garrison their, Khan Pryde authorized Galaxy Commander Rard Hoyt to retake Butler, and ensure the integrity of the Falcon's Occupation Zone. Galaxy Commander Hoyt selected five trinaries to retake the world from mostly conventional forces left behind to defend Butler, reinforced by two Blue Star Irregular companies. The Falcon trinaries landed on the 18th of June, and by the 25th had retaken the world.</Description>

    <Description>Founded in 3018, Butte hold is one of the more recent additions to the many Bandit Kingdoms. The inhabitants are a motley collection of cutthroats nominally under the control of Redjack Ryan, an arrogant, strutting MechWarrior with delusions of grandeur. The Pirates of Butte Hold epitomize the worst characteristics of Periphery Bandits.&#xD; Redjack Ryan was once a battalion commander under Hendrik Grimm. In 3017, while on "loan" to the Free Worlds League, Ryan's unit was ordered to occupy a Steiner  border world. During the course of the occupation, Ryan's troops sacked the cities, enslaved the populace, and destroyed many industries, including a fusion power plant. The destruction of the power plant poisoned half the planet's atmosphere, bringing an immediate halt to Ryan's carousing.&#xD; Following this blunder, troops from both the Oberon Confederation and the Lyran Commonwealth pursued Ryan and his mob out of the Inner Sphere. Ryan took his men to Butte Hold, where he set up shop. Since then, the bandit has launched indiscriminate raids against the Lyran Commonwealth, the Draconis Combine, and even an occasional snipe of the Oberon Confederation. To date, none of these governments have retaliated because of the many prisoners Ryan holds hostage. Few like to contemplate what an angry Ryan might do.&#xD; Another version of the story of how Ryan broke away from Oberon states that Ryan has apparently no other interests in life than rapine, and so he could not face the prospect of handling actual responsibilities, as Grimm wanted him to do. Whether Ryan's own most viscous lieutenant, Agnar Satanson, will turn on Ryan the way he turned on Grimm remains to be seen.&#xD; Attracted by the lure of booty, Ryan has won numerous recruits since his break with Grimm, enough to maintain two battalions of BattleMechs. Ryan's hold on his subordinates is tenuous at best, however. He spends much of his time guarding against a knife in the back as he does planning his next raid. Left to their own devices, the pirates of Butte Hold may well destroy themselves. In addition, one raid too many against an irritated Lyran of Draconis government may bring a full-scale assault against the pirate holdfast.&#xD; [3049] Clan Wolf landed on Butte Hold in September 3049. The Bronze Keshik was unopposed when it invaded this barren, thinly populated world.</Description>

In nine months, the planet was the property of the Lyran Commonwealth, though no one knew what use they would be able to make of the half-devastated planet. &#xD; [3025] During the ensuing Succession Wars, Caldrea once more became a possession of the Draconis Combine, and today is the site of an important industrial facility and a major Kuritan naval base.

    <Description>[2584] The assassination of General Kincaid in 2583, by a Taurian commando, paralyzed the Star League war effort for the rest of the year and well into the next. With the first campaigns of the Reunification War enfolding against the Rim Worlds Republic, control of the various Taurian commands fell to individual corps commanders, none of whom were capable of coordinating their efforts. In summer 2584, Star League High Command General Amos Forlough was recalled from his operations against the Outworlds Alliance to restore control.&#xD; General Forlough was given a veritable carte blanche on men and material to resume offensive operations. Using striker regiments raised and trained by his predecessor, he began a scorched-earth policy. Amongst his first targets was the world of Caldwell.&#xD; Forlough first blockaded the target system and demanded an unconditional surrender of all Taurian forces within 30 days. When the allotted time elapsed, the General's strikers had total freedom, not only to destroy the determined Taurian defenders, but to also render useless any and all sources of economic and military potential. While bands of Star League Marauders and Warhammers ravaged the countryside, destroying crops, food stores, and munitions depots, Forlough's navy warded off repeated attempts by the Taurian fleet to break through the blockade. &#xD; Caldwell fell to the Star League in November 2584.</Description>

    <Description>Possessing abundant water, mineral, and agricultural resources, Callison was easily established as a colony world in the early days of mankind's expansion to the stars. Settlements quickly grew into cities as deposits of valuable industrial metals and rare gems gave rise to a booming economy, supported by vast tracts of arable lands. &#xD; Originally claimed by the Lyran Commonwealth's Federation of Skye, the heavily urbanized and industrialized world was claimed quickly by House Marik's Free Worlds League during the Age of War, and it was still a Marik holding when the Terran Hegemony rose to prominence in the years that followed. As a key border world and hub of trade during the Star League era, Callison came to be jointly administered by the Hegemony and the Free Worlds League through the Star League era, reverting to full Marik control only after the Amaris Crisis and the collapse of the Star League. &#xD; Once again, the value of this planet made it a bone of contention between the Free Worlds League and the Lyran Commonwealth as the Succession Wars began. Thus, in an effort to counter numerous Steiner efforts to capture the world, Callison joined with other nearby worlds to form the Silver Hawks Coalition in 2966. Though this mini-state of the Free Worlds League enjoyed greater coordinated defense, the formation of the Coalition did little to curb Lyran raiders and invasion fleets. &#xD; Throughout the Succession Wars this world would see heavy fighting that devastated such major cities as Harzburg, Mountainside, and Rolso, as well as the asteroid-mining operations in the nearby Zesamali Belt. Despite these assaults, Callison remained a Marik holding until the fourth and final Succession War, when Lyran mercenaries finally seized the world with a decisive battle at the capital city of Fallosha. Steiner victory, however, proved short-lived, for within two generations Callison once more lay under the League�s purple eagle banner after Operation Guerrero broke the back of the once-mighty Federated Commonwealth. &#xD; The capital city and main spaceport of Fallosha is located on Callison's northern island continent of Grayle. A second spaceport city, New Rolso, is located on the equatorial landmass of Vantassa, which is also home to Callison Enterprises, a local shipping cartel.</Description>

    <Description>Located in the Duchy of Oriente, Calloway VI is one of the most prosperous planets in the Inner Sphere due to the business acumen of its merchants. There are no exportable raw materials, and almost all necessities must be imported, including the metal for the BattleMech factories located there. Because of the success of this trading colony, the Duke of Oriente had his winter retreat built there in the late 2400's.&#xD; In fact, the people of Calloway VI are so mercantile that they hunted the vast herds of Calloway Wildebeests (similar to the Terran Wildebeest) to extinction for their meat, hides, and tusks, which were prized by ivory carvers throughout the Inner Sphere. In the late 24th century, environmentalists tried to preserve these beautiful animals. By that time, however, the herds had been reduced below the critical number of animals necessary to breed, and so they passed into extinction (along with several other species of indigenous lifeforms).&#xD; One of the most unusual aspects of life on Calloway VI is that there is no true night. The three large moons that circle the planet reflect so much sunlight that nowhere on the planet has it been necessary to install streetlights. Natives who visit other worlds tend to be inordinately afraid of the dark.</Description>

    <Description>Clinging to the edge of the Free Worlds League as if fearful it might be flung off into uncharted space, Campoleone exists as little&#xD;more than a trade way-station. Subsistence-level agriculture takes place on this chilly world, principally in the lowlands of the Cosenza continent and along the valley of the Pao River, but for the most part inhabitants rely on goods brought in by passing traders, many of whom have villas in the hills around Ausapolis, the planet�s single major settlement. With its lack of modern amenities, Campoleone has an austere beauty that makes it a popular retirement location for spacers (though few can afford the luxury of the merchants� villas), and over the centuries it has earned a reputation as the place to go to dig up information on the Periphery realms and the Deep Dark. According to local tradition, a share in profits made using information obtained on Campoleone is given to those who aid the endeavor, easing the flow of information&#xD;but also generating considerable speculation and guesswork as less scrupulous individuals seek to con visitors. Those who stoop to such methods find their welcome on Campoleone quickly exhausted, as honest dealings are a core tenet of the spacer community.&#xD; Beyond the spaceport city, Campoleone has little industrial or commercial activity, and much of the planet�s agricultural produce is traded via a barter economy. Only the logging of ebony-like ginja wood on Cosenza and in the distant Torino Islands, prized by craftsmen across the League, takes place on a semi-commercial basis. The scarcity of the trees limits their commercial exploitation, and so far attempts to farm them have produced inferior crops. Some prospectors&#xD;spend weeks tracking down the best stands of ginja trees before calling in the LoggerMechs.&#xD; Little known to outsiders until recently, the Voidjumper�s Memorial on the peak of Mount Kenley-Maccan stands as a testament to spacefaring vessels lost in the Free Worlds. According to space tradition, the families of crews leave keepsakes at the memorial to show that the vessel, though lost, is not forgotten. At present the monument covers three acres, centered on the Angel of Campoleone, a 20-meter tall myomer-kinetic sculpture by Durr�s.</Description>

    <Description>Canopus IV is the mother-world of the Magistracy. Founded in early 2530 by a band of ex-Marik soldiers of fortune, the planet turned out to be rich in mineral and natural resources. It has been greatly exploited over the last two centuries, with wide-scale strip mining creating extreme soil erosion and ecological damage. At present, the planet's resources are on the decline, and best estimates show that, at the present rate of consumption, Canopus will no longer be able to sustain itself within the next generation. Especially alarming is evidence of a radical shift in the planet's weather patterns that, if not adjusted, could result in a gradual cooling of the planet's surface.&#xD; In addition to being the seat of the Canopian government, Canopus IV possesses one of the last remaining Canopian entertainment concerns. On the planet's northern continent, regular line and conventional militia contingents defend a handful of small factories, few of which are automated.&#xD; [3025] Founded in the heyday of the Magistracy's golden age of commerce, Canopian Delights Limited remains the largest commercial enterprise in the realm. Providing live entertainment, both public and private, for business or personal consumption, CDL is one of the economy's few remaining major money-makers.</Description>

Permanent garrisons of two reserve regiments with AeroSpace support are supplemented by well-fortified ground installations, managed by highly motivated militia forces.  Capella is corporate headquarters for the powerful Ceres Metals and Capellan Commonality Bank. The capital city of Capella is Capella Prime.&#xD; [3025] Capella is the site of one of the 16 Philotechnique Institutes. These serve the Capellan state as special post-secondary institutions. Established originally in the mid-28th century as technical and scientific training centers, the institutes today also emphasize "philosophical" (political) training. Admission to a Philotechnique Institute is by special recommendation of a planetary director only, and all expenses are paid by the state. Often enough, students in these institutions have previously served with distinction as members of the Ranks of the Dedicated. Graduates who are not technically oriented are placed in positions of administrative responsibility, or are recruited into the ranks of the Maskirovka.</Description>

    <Description>Caph was one of the first worlds that Human space explorers settled after the Kearny-Fuchida drive made interstellar space travel possible. During the Star League era, Caph was a center for advanced engineering research. Indeed, much of the original theory behind the newly invented BattleMechs was developed at the famed Caph Institute of Technology. Caph was also famous for successful medical research and for the development of important new techniques in the field.  With the fall of the Star League, Caph became the center of bitter fighting between the Draconis Combine, the Capellan Confederation, and the Federated Suns. In 2787, the Fifth Battle for Caph became one of the few instances where three realms battled one another on the same planet. The Federated Suns was the eventual victory on Caph, however.  What House Davion inherited was a planet full of ruins and radiation zones. Ninety-nine percent of all the world's buildings had been destroyed, and the little remaining arable land had suffered from the effects of combat. Only now is the planet slowly recovering, with a growth in population and the construction of a few small factories. Even more important is that Caph's location makes it the ideal site for offices and warehouses of many Federated Suns trading companies interested in dealing with the rich Lyran Commonwealth. With the recent alliance between the two realms, this planet's usefulness and importance can only grow greater.  The capital city of Caph is Aswan.</Description>

Caripare's position in the Smoke Jaguar - Nova Cat corridor, near the front lines but far enough away to eliminate it as an easy target for raiders, made Clan Nova Cat eager to conquer this productive agricultural world was as little damage as possible.&#xD; Hoping for any easy victory against an inexperienced unit, but well aware that the Combine commander might have lied about his troops strength of configuration, Star Colonel Gritas bid to take the planet with two Trinaries of the First Nova Cat Guards. The Clan forces landed near Johnson Lake and immediately came under attack by elements of the elite Second Ghost Regiment hidden in the water's depths.&#xD; This deception set the tone for the hard-fought battle that followed. Star Colonel Gritas eventually called down another Trinary, justifying the fact that she broke her bid by pointing to the Kurita commander's misinformation and reiterating the Khans' desire to use the planet for supply purposes. The additional troops allowed her to take the world, but could not help her avoid a fierce running battle that destroyed the centuries old Trevorton Forest.&#xD; Recognizing Caripare's strategic importance, Clan Smoke Jaguar immediately challenged Clan Nova Cat to a Trial of Possession for the planet. Unwilling to destroy any more of Caripare's resources, the Khans of both Clans agreed, after a long and acrimonious debate, to share the conquest of the world and administer it jointly.&#xD; [3059] During Operation Bulldog, The Fifth Nova Cat Regulars were defeated on Caripare, by the First Shin Legion in a straight-up fight. As new warriors of the SLDF, the Fifth then moved against the Second Jaguar Guards, along with two Trinaries of the Star League Nova Cat Guards, the Second An Ting Legion, the Seventy-Ninth Division, the First Fusiliers of Oriente, and the First St. Ives Lancers.

Lewis Incorporated (makers of the ultra-light Savannah Master hovercraft and a host of civilian vehicles), Carlisle is understandably a world of major importance to the security of the Lyran state, and so boasts a full militia command raised from the local population and several nearby worlds.&#xD; Founded by German and Slovak peoples, Carlisle's early settlers raised a society largely based on the culture of Europe's Central and Eastern regions, and the dominant languages spoken here are German and Czech. Because so much of the local industry depends on defense, the people of this world are vocal proponents of the LAAF, though they retain much of the pro-peace attitudes seen throughout Alarion Province. &#xD; Carlisle's capital city, New Prague, is located on the large northern temperate continent of Worrsetgard, which is also home to the Bowie Industries plant.

Though he raised a fairly large militia force, they were no match for Davion regulars, particularly since the Capellan WarShips were annihilated in the Battle of Kigamboni in late 2565. &#xD; This halted Roger's advance on new Syrtis, where he had hoped to gain massive support from long-time Varney supporters. The Davion 'Mechs of the Eighth Syrtis Fusiliers caught him in a retreat to the frontier, destroying Varney's force almost to a man.

    <Description>Lacking in significant resources or strategic value, the warm, oppressive world of Carnwath was never regarded as worth anyone's time during the Succession Wars. However, in the early days of space exploration and colonization, Carnwath was the center of a minor - and very brief - alien scare when its first settlers described what appeared to be the remains of an ancient civilization, complete with the remains of a strange species of bipedal creatures. &#xD; At the crux of this discovery were several mysterious formations that resembled vaguely humanoid faces, reminiscent of the figures on Terra's Easter Island, ringing a central cluster of five jagged, pyramidal structures that actually gave off radioactive readings. Archaeologists were dispatched to Carnwath almost immediately, and studied the "alien structures" for less than six months before concluding that they were a peculiarity of native processes of wind and water erosion that had exposed evidence from a long-ago asteroid strike on the planet's northern continent of Wartholi. &#xD; The meteor, evidently composed mainly of metallic ores and unusual - but naturally occurring - radium, was partially liquefied by the heat of reentry and fragmented on impact. Several larger cores formed the basis of the pyramids while smaller chunks of matter, blown clear of the central site, formed a ring at the edges of the crater. Over millennia, erosion wiped away the softer native soil around the site, exposing the mildly radioactive "pyramids" and "faces."&#xD; Though believers in extraterrestrial intelligence argued these theories, the final evidence became clear when exo-biologists proved the "humanoid" remains found nearby were nothing more than an alien variation on ancient Terra's velociraptors, and various biological features of the long-dead amphibian beasts proved they were nothing more than desert scavengers, likely struck down by the very same phenomenon that produced the so-called "ruins."&#xD; Though discredited, the Ruins of Carnwath continue to draw the curious and die-hard believers in alien intelligence to this world almost 800 years later. This tourism industry, however, has proven barely sufficient to supplement the planet's annual income from its very average industrial and agricultural exports.&#xD; Carnwath's capital city, Carnwath City, is located on the Wartholi continent, three hundred kilometers east of the Ruins of Carnwath. Though it is regarded as the center of planetary commerce and industry, with over two million inhabitants in the capital alone, the southern continents of Blanith and Kormyri actually boast a full three quarters of the Carnwathian population.</Description>

    <Description>Located on the border with the Draconis Combine, the planet Carse is another veteran of many battles and raids.  This world has binary suns.  Because of the unusually elliptical orbit and its relation to the two stars, there are four different season cycles.  Currently the planet is in a Cold Cycle, where the smaller Class M sun, called Companion, occludes the larger sun and blocks much of its heat.  As a result, the world is blanketed with snow, and the smallest ocean, Minor Mare, is frozen over.  Ships are useless during the Cold Cycle, and so industries use powered sledges to carry cargo across Minor Mare.  Only DropShips and the largest Air Freighters can cope with the planet's constant winter winds.  Carse is a center of plastic and plastisteel manufacturing, which draw on the large deposits of oil and unusual chemicals in the planet's geology.&#xD;  Carse has been fortunate in avoiding war damage.  Though many a 'Mech has lumbered across the planet's large expanses of empty land and many forests have also suffered from the onslaught, the cities have come through in fairly good condition.  At the moment, the capital city of New Bonholm is the headquarters of the 23rd Arcturan Guards.&#xD; [3052] The Wolves of Delta Galaxy made a rare mistake by landing on the planet's southern continent. The northern continent held both the capital city, and the majority of the planet's resources and industry. The poor choice of LZ allowed the command staff of the Second Freemen to scout the composition of the enemy and recognize that they were once again hopelessly outgunned. The constant frigid storms that whip Carse grounded all aerospace fighters, however, providing the Freemen with cover when they met the Red Keshik, Eleventh Wolf Guards, and the 37th Striker Cluster at the battles of Molde and Trosa. The Freemen earned the Wolves' respect before being forced offworld to Udea.</Description>

    <Description>The first colonists to settle Carsphairn were quickly taken in by its varied landscapes, every bit as striking as those of Terra itself. Unfortunately, these settlers soon learned that their new home was cursed with violent weather systems, largely attributed to the pull of not one, but three large moons. The turbulent weather varies from continuous, weeks-long spring and autumn downpours to frequent tornadoes in the summer, and crippling blizzards and ice storms in the winter - all particularly brutal in the middle latitudes. &#xD; Despite this, Carsphairn's soil proved fertile enough to sustain Terran hybrid crops, and the local animals - particularly the populous, buffalo-like elwriths - provided a readily accessible food source to sustain several modest colonies. In addition, sufficient mineral wealth to provide for a rudimentary level of industrialization and export trade - if not a particularly profitable one - enabled the colonists to establish strong roots and thriving townships. To withstand the effects of the storms, the Carsphairnians built their structures low, and erected protective domes over many of their farms, and continue to do so to this day.&#xD; Located several jumps inside the Federation of Skye, Carsphairn was largely overlooked during the Succession Wars. Perhaps because of this, many natives of this world saw the Lyran government as even more intrusive than did other Skye worlds that bordered hostile neighbors, and thus the local government was more easily swayed to join the Free Skye movement. &#xD; The planetary capital of Carsphairn, Narcisse, is located on the primary continent of Gillinia. A shoreline city, Narcisse has a large seaport as well as a spaceport, linking travelers to the other four main landmasses of Basallia, North Teslia, South Teslia, and Yddrig.</Description>

    <Description>[3039] Cartago was not originally included in the list of targets that Kanrei Kurita approved for Operation Orochi, but as the counter-invasion progressed, it became obvious that Prince Davion was not yet willing to put an end to the war. Kurita�s war planners were not willing to give up just yet, though. They proposed that perhaps a wider base of targets just might convince Prince Davion that New Avalon was the ultimate goal of the counter-invasion and thus force him to call off his own invasion. The invasion of Cartago didn�t quite have that effect, but the fact that Davion ultimately recalled his units is all that mattered to Kurita.&#xD; The only significant problem with targeting Cartago was the fact that the DCMS didn�t have any �extra� �Mech units that it could task to strike at the world. The great majority of the Combine military had been mobilized to respond to the �Davion aggression� and given combat assignments. Other than the Ghost and Ryuken regiments already involved in Operation OROCHI, along with what mercenary units Tai-sa Tomoe Sakade could hire on Le Blanc, the only �uncommitted� units anywhere close to Cartago were those assigned to the defense of Proserpina. And while Kurita had instructed his generals to �damn the defensive lines� and mobilize everything along the front, even he couldn�t go so far as to leave the important world of Proserpina undefended.&#xD; Nevertheless, there were no other units available, and so Kanrei Kurita authorized the Ninth Benjamin Regulars � the only �Mech unit remaining on Proserpina � to detach a battalion of volunteers for a strike at Cartago. Chu-sa Hohijo Bradbury had no shortage of volunteers, and left Proserpina in late August, grounding on 21 September. Just as on Breed, these Combine MechWarriors remained on the move and often reorganized, making Cartago�s defenders � three conventional infantry and light armor regiments left behind when the Clovis DMM left to respond to the Ryuken strike on Clovis � believe there was an entire �Mech regiment on the world. Chu-sa Bradbury�s �Mechs struck what few military targets they could find, stealing away with consumable supplies enough to keep a full regiment fighting for a month, and likewise struck at significant communications, industrial and commerce targets before they left a week later. &#xD; The frantic battle reports from Cartago�s people, along with unconfirmed sightings of Combine ships in the Johnsondale and Barstow Systems were convincing enough to the AFFS High Command that the DCMS could be following a second axis of attack, aimed right at New Avalon. In reality, Bradbury�s volunteers returned to Proserpina, their jobs done.</Description>

    <Description>More than 85% of Carver V's surface is covered by pale blue seas, making it an important source of water for drier Hegemony worlds. The planet's many aquatic lifeforms, the ocean-going reptiles called Crocales being the most spectacular, were soon exploited by colonists. Crocales were hunted for their hides, which made an iridescent green leather much loved by the rich of the Star League.&#xD; The Hegemony government built fortifications on Carver because it bordered the Capellan Confederation, a realm that was not a trusted neighbor. The nature of the planet made the construction of Castles Brian impractical. In 2402, construction began on the Quantico Marine Fortification around the planet's largest island.&#xD; The first line of defense in this unusual fortress was an extensive series of weapon towers surrounding the island. Looking like the teeth of some gaping mouth, each tower was topped with at least one weapons turret to shoot down approaching ships or aircraft. Each tower was connected to Quantico by tunnels. The island itself, with its mountains and lush tropical life, had two major spaceports, El Toru and Baku. It also had several fortified naval bases to launch submarines and other vessels.&#xD; When the Star League was formed, Quantico was chosen to be the administrative and training center of the Star League Marine Corps. Camp Pendleton, just outside Bellacqu, the planet's largest city, became SLMC headquarters. A small island next to Quantico was renamed Parris Island and turned into a massive boot camp.&#xD; Troops of the Rim Worlds Republic launched one of their most relentless attacks to take Quantico. The tenacious defense by the three CAAN regiments became one of the most stirring stories to come out of the dark days of the Civil War. After destroying Republican forces stationed with them on the island, the Marines fought off repeated assaults by Republican forces. For the next six years, the Amaris forces threw themselves at the Marines, only to be pushed back into the sea.&#xD; Just when the Marines' parts and supplies were running low, the Third Regimental Combat Team, the Eridani Light Horse, fought through Republican forces to bring the Marines equipment. With new supplies, the Marines held onto Quantico until they were relieved by General Kerensky in 2773.&#xD; Today, very little remains of the fortification. What was left after the years of fighting was stripped away before the Exodus by General Kerensky�s forces, leaving empty towers jutting out of the water around the island.</Description>

For a time, the Free Worlds League claimed Cate's Hold, but the population managed to rebel and win their freedom at the start of the Second Succession War. &#xD; In the last century, the discovery of large deposits of radioactives in the planet's southern hemisphere, coupled with the recent discovery of caches of Star League equipment, have done much to make this a strategically important Periphery world. As a result, the Magistracy and the Taurians have clashed numerous times over the control of Cate's Hold in the last 50 years, which has strained relations between the two governments. Despite numerous attempts by the Taurians to wrest control of the planet from the Canopians, determined resistance combined with superior local technology has so far allowed the Canopians to keep a firm hold on this border world. &#xD; At present, the population of Cate's Hold is approximately 20000, many of whom continue to serve in local militia and home-defense companies each year under the direction of Canopian military advisors.</Description>

    <Description>Discovered in the late 2290s, Cavanaugh was not settled until 2325 when the planet was first sold to a wealthy member of the former English royal court. Duke Alvin Windsor-Moon organized a team made up of English, Welsh and Scots to colonize Cavanaugh. Included in this group of settlers were the entire Arthurian Actors Guild.&#xD; The settlers were not accustomed to the planet�s climate and atmospheric conditions, however. Cavanaugh�s star was older and hotter than Terra�s and the planet�s average temperature was 15�C higher than their former homeland. Happily, the planet was rich in timber and the soil fertile; Cavanaugh would support those that had come to settle it.&#xD; In honor of their heritage, colonists named the planet�s island continents and moons after English historical figures and places, according to their Cambridge historians. Of Cavanaugh�s five continents, only one was uninhabitable. Named after Mordred, because of the massive volcanic activity and unstable land no one could live there and survive. Bedivere, Tristram, Gareth and Gawain, all similar in size to the Terran continent of Australia, support Cavanaugh�s population. The capital of Caerleon is built on an island in reproduction of its namesake.</Description>

    <Description>Less than hospitable, even before the arrival of human colonists, Cebalrai was settled more as a waystation than as a home to millions of people. With a thin atmosphere and a flimsy ozone layer, this world is continuously doused by far too much solar radiation from its giant K2 star, and so the first colonists to this world-and all their descendants since-erected partially reflective domes and screens over their structures and smaller communities. &#xD; During the Age of War that preceded the rise of the Star League, renegade forces hit Cebalrai from a neighboring system and employed nuclear weapons against the capital city of Wade to cover their escape. Extensive efforts to cure the planet's ills, both natural and manmade, were undertaken with aid from Star League engineers during the height of humanity's Golden Age, restoring and purifying much of Cebalrai's air and water. Remarkably, even the hellish warfare that raged after the fall of the League did not visit this world with the same punishment as the Age of War, though continuing border clashes between Houses Steiner and Kurita frequently left the rocky landscape and delicate woodlands scarred by conventional weaponry.&#xD; Cebalrai's capital city, New Wade, is located on the north polar continent of Sarrina, and is also home to the planet's single major spaceport. Lennori, the planet's other northern continent, is only habitable into its middle latitudes, as temperatures and other solar radiation hazards closer to the equatorial zones have rendered the southern reaches and the nearby equatorial continent of Hellesdon barren desert wastes.</Description>

    <Description>[2583] The Star League's 2nd Corps, under the command of General Forlough, landed on Cerberus in early 2583. A desert world, Cerberus was one of the few Outworlds Alliance worlds that had any industrial base at all, and was also a provincial capital. With the planet's 'Mech garrison unable to re-deploy in time, the local militia was scattered in short order. There followed several months of angry reprisals in which Forlough's warriors put entire towns to the torch.&#xD; [2585] After the disastrous events on Tellman IV in the autumn of 2583, and the replacement of General Forlough in summer 2584, the war in the Alliance gradually wound down. Unable to obtain reinforcements for a major push on Alpheratz and all too conscious of the fact that another Tellman IV would spell the end of his military career, Major-General Franklin Barnex (Forlough's replacement), remained content to hang onto the worlds won by his predecessor. The Alliance campaign began to stagnate, punctuated only by occasional clashes with Kuritan BattleMechs.&#xD; In 2585, a Star League peace commission succeeded in negotiating the Peace of Cerberus, ending this part of the Reunification War. The Alliance was granted local autonomy under the direction of a council of Terran Policy Directors. The Alliance had originally offered to sue for peace in return for the concession that General "Baby Killer" Forlough be tried on Alpheratz for war crimes, but the Star League refused.</Description>

    <Description>A dry world toward the fringes of the League, Cerillos is renowned for its hardy if somewhat insular inhabitants. Descended from the Hispanic and Indian peoples of southwestern North America, the population is proud and self-reliant, placing considerable emphasis on strength and personal honor. A spirit of machismo dominates on Cerillos (and several surrounding worlds in the unofficial �Trinity� province that also includes Galisteo and Sierra), as does a level of chauvinism and prejudice uncommon in the Free Worlds League, attitudes protected by the �cultural identity� provisions of the federal charter. Only a handful of population centers exist on the continents of Las Cruces, Mazatl�n and Santa Rosa, with most of the population residing on scattered ranches and haciendas. The planetary capital, Puerto Cort�s in the Rio Vicente valley, is the site of one the Free Worlds� largest cattle markets every autumn.&#xD; With a largely agrarian economy � Cerillos� only substantive exports are animal products, principally beef raised in the high plains of Alamogordo and San Clemente � little wealth exists on any of the �southwestern� worlds. This makes joining the military an attractive option. The inhabitants of Cerillos are generally tough and skilled fighters, provided their aggression can be channeled and they heed authority. The mercenary command Camacho�s Caballeros typifies the martial ideal of Cerillos and its fellow southwestern worlds (the Caballeros� leader, Carlos Camacho, hails from nearby Galisteo). On all three planets, brotherhoods of retired soldiers form strong bonds that rival even these worlds� intense family loyalties. Some of these brotherhoods are little more the social gatherings where old soldiers can meet, drink, and trade war stories, but the ones in the upper echelons of society are martial orders with intricate rituals and structures.</Description>

It had its origins as a bottled mineral water company that look advantage of the planet's many mineral springs. With the rise of Star League technology, the Trethel family used their riches to open five water purification factories, four of which were destroyed by House Kurita's special forces units at the start of the First Succession War. The remaining factory in Thousand Springs is on the verge of complete collapse because it lacks parts and because of centuries' worth of jury-rigged repairs.&#xD; Thanks to the rise of the NAIS and the discovery of the Star League Memory Core, however, Cerulean Waters experienced a technological renaissance. Borrowing heavily to upgrade its factory on Cerulean, the company bounced back, ultimately opening factories on two more Federated Suns worlds, one in the former Sarna March and even one in the Lyran Alliance over the course of the next three decades. During that same timeframe, it began to construct major water extraction and purification plants on worlds, both major and minor, throughout the Federated Suns, marketing its product as Cerulean Aqua. Though not as high-end as other popular spring and mineral waters, the Cerulean Aqua brand is becoming more and more popular, with smaller purification systems now installed in food markets all over the Suns.</Description>

    <Description>Not a particularly appealing world, Chaffee is hot and relatively dry, orbiting too close for comfort to its white sun. Although possessing some valuable minerals and metal ores, Chaffee has no particular industry; its half-billion population is sufficiently occupied eking out a living from agriculture and keeping at bay the world�s amazingly diverse and contentious fauna. The planet�s major source of income comes from safaris to hunt the various horrors, from hectare-sized swarms of tiny acid beetles to pack-predating aliosaurs. &#xD; Chaffee�s eastern hemisphere is dominated by the mountainous super-continent of Addisonia; temperate in its northern latitudes and well forested. Almost all the planets cities are located along its north-eastern seacoasts. The planetary capital of McCauliffe is located on a large north-eastern peninsula - making it the eastern-most city on Addisonia. McCauliffe is home to a population of more than a million, with the planet�s lone spaceport located to the west of the city, and the Siegfuhr airport on the east, just north of the harbour.&#xD; Chaffee�s other major population centers include the seaport of Lazenby, with a population of eighty-five thousand, and the inland city of Hamilton sited on the Yeoh river, with a population of fifty-five thousand. The remainder of the populace live in scattered homesteads. &#xD; Combined with the lack of a particularly impressive road network, this makes air travel the favored means of on-planet transport even when not an outright necessity. The lucrative off-world hunting trade has served the planet well in this regard, providing sufficient offworld exchange to make air travel affordable. Airports are dotted across the world, and few and far between are the settlements that don�t possess at least one VTOL or fixed-wing aircraft; indeed many families possess their own. &#xD; Off-planet replacement parts are hard to come by, nor cheap. Though relatively poor, Chaffee�s population springs from highly resourceful stock - by the very fact of simply surviving upon the arid, high gee planet with its contentious wildlife. The world has abundant metal deposits, even if large-scale mining had never come to the planet, largely because of its hostile environment (and in later years due to environmental laws enacted to maintain it in relatively pristine hostility). As such, Chaffeans make their own replacement parts, even if they had to use their own manual mills, lathes and welding rigs in homestead workshops.&#xD; Lacking a military tradition to speak of, Chaffee possesses only a small militia force. However, the planet�s exotic fauna ensures that almost all of the ciybound inhabitants carry small arms of some kind. Outside the cities all the inhabitants carry weapons in their vehicles - usually in the form of high-powered laser rifles - for defense against local animals. Even homestead children are taught to use weapons from an early age � it being perfectly acceptable on Chafee for parents needing to leave their children at home with a Zeus Heavy rifle! And for hunting or protection against from some of the larger local fauna, nothing less than portable SRM�s or even man-pack PPC�s are required.</Description>

    <Description>Chahar, when first discovered in 24th century, was a lifeless world, despite the planet's large ocean and agreeable climate.  When the initial survey discovered major deposits of chemicals and metals, colonization of this barren world became more viable.  By the beginning of the next century, there existed a significant population, most of whom were employed by Trans-India Mining Industries.&#xD; Chahar's inability to feed itself placed a major burden on neighboring planets until the Steiner government financed a major effort to introduce plant and animal life to the planet.  The project was a complete success, with an amazing percentage of introduced species thriving in their new environment.&#xD; Today, Chahar can feed its own population and even exports some grain to other worlds. The planet has a vigorous economy that is actively courting major Commonwealth industries to open factories here. Its industries won a major economic battle with the neighboring world of Blue Hole, when Trellshire Heavy Industries built a weapons plant near Chahar's capital city, Benares.&#xD; Chahar has one of the largest Hindu populations of any Lyran world, and a whole city has been set aside for the sole purpose of worship.&#xD; [3025] The city of New Mannos on Chahar is the headquarters to Dobless Information Services. Having started business with information stored in a single Star League library computer system, Dobless has become the de facto storehouse of information for the Commonwealth. With centers on more than 150 worlds, each of its computers stores information comparable to over 100 billion books.&#xD; The vaults deep below the main offices on Chahar are rumored to contain information storage devices that pre-date man's ability to travel in space. The rumor is that Dobless library computer contains all known information in the universe, if one knows how to access it. The company is on good terms with House Steiner, and there are rumors that CEO Jim Tobiasson will be titled at the next session of the Royal Court.  &#xD; [3064] The Chahar MTM attempted to hold out for as long as possible when the Falcons attacked in early December, 3064, but against five Clusters, including Khan Marthe's own Turkina Keshik, they stood no chance. The four surviving combat commands retreated to Zhongshan sixteen days after the Falcons landed.&#xD; [3067] Unfortunately, the recent seizure of the Dobless Information Service�s former headquarters on Chahar by Jade Falcon forces has cut off the company from its largest data node, and forced present CEO Seth Tobiason to relocate to Ludwigshafen. Since then, Tobiason has suggested to his shareholders that Dobless may soon commission a mercenary expedition to Chahar to liberate the larger archives said to be buried deep beneath the captured company headquarters complex.</Description>

Generals Steiner and Christifori escaped Chapultepec before von Jankmon could pin them down and call Khan Pryde in to finish them off. By retreating from the world on the 25th August, the Lyran Generals ceded control of the world to Galaxy Commander von Jankmon.&#xD; General Jasper Zibler dispatched a mixed combat command from his Seventh Crucis Lancers to the world in late May 3065.

    <Description>Legend has it that Chara received the name Pacifica from its first explorer, who was fortunate enough to arrive on a placid day. In fact, this water-rich, Terra-like world soon proved to be anything but tranquil to the colonists who came afterward � though the name stuck, curiously enough. Thanks to a fast rotation � fourteen standard hours, compared to Terra's twenty-four � and the lack of a moon to slow it down, the planet's weather systems are in constant turmoil. &#xD; Sudden rain - or thunderstorms rage across the temperate coastal regions, while fierce blizzards and punishing downpours of freezing rain frequent the northern and southern latitudes � most coming from skies that seemed clear just minutes before. But even as the natives came to describe their weather by paraphrasing the favored line of Terra's New England region � �if you don't like the weather here, just wait a minute and it'll change� � the planet soon became an agricultural paradise. &#xD; Starpad, an agro-commune established soon after the first settlers arrived here, is the largest agriplex on the planet, situated just 150 kilometers south of the planetary capital city of Farhaven on the northern Azula continent. During the Succession Wars, in fact, the output of this single, ninety-kilometer-diameter patch of farmland was so great that its exports to agriculturally poorer neighbors prompted the need for a full battalion of permanent garrison troops. Many raids by House Kurita were launched against this planet, despite the impressive garrison. Perhaps the worst of the fighting occurred between Combine forces as the defending mercenary Kell Hounds regiment on the eve of the Fourth Succession War, when the planet was briefly invaded. &#xD; In addition to Azula and Verdez, a third continent, Rojia, straddles the planetary equator. Though its location and mountainous coastlines minimize the effects of the planet's worst weather systems, this landmass is the most underpopulated, largely due to the fact that its interior reaches are almost all desert and badlands, thanks to a lack of inland riverways and lakes.</Description>

    <Description>Though water-poor and blasted by a hot, white star, Chertan has nevertheless managed to support a thriving industrial colony since it was founded in mankind's early exodus from Terra. Abundant mineral and metallurgical resources made possible the founding of several settlements based around mining, refining, and manufacturing operations, despite the lack of arable land. Thanks to the growth of nearby agricultural worlds and a brisk trade, Chertan prospered from its export of raw materials and heavy machinery, and continued to do so until after the fall of the original Star League. &#xD; As part of the Free Worlds League's Marik Principality, perilously close to the Steiner border, Chertan became a magnet for Lyran invasions and raids, which left the planet's surface scarred and battered, and decimated the few farms capable of supplementing the population's needs, as well as many industrial centers. The results of these raids and invasions created generations of starving inhabitants as off-world trade became disrupted during wartime, and led to several food riots, including one that led to the dismissal of the planetary viscount in 2820. &#xD; The planetary capital and primary spaceport of Chertan is Theleopolis, located just south of the Huron Sea, in the planet's southern hemisphere. Altonia, the third largest city after Theleopolis and New Pittsburgh, is located near the eastern edge of the Ontario Sea, and is home to Artista Chemicals, Chertan's largest mineral mining and refining operation.</Description>

Dubbing the largest of these townships Remembrance and establishing it as their capital city, the second wave of Chichibu colonists quickly spread out over the primary continent of Jaweena. They found a world similar in many ways to Terra, with fertile lands, diverse climates and ample waters. &#xD; The planet's mineral wealth, while lacking in heavy metals or precious gems, is nonetheless sufficient to sustain a steady mining and refining industry, combined with a prosperous aqua-ranching trade centered on the Chichiban whale. The dominant life form in the planet's vast oceans, this large aquatic mammal, almost twice the size of the Terran killer whale, is prized for its tender, protein-rich meat and the valuable oils found in its thick layers of blubber.&#xD; Ecologists initially argued against the formation of a whaling industry, fearing the widespread hunting that decimated similar species on Terra before the end of the 21st century. To allay these fears, the planetary government strictly enforces designated no-fishing areas between the northern and southern semi-arctic zones and maintains a whale-breeding program to sustain the population. This has transformed whaling on Chichibu from a hunting sport to more of a ranching industry. &#xD; Besides the large continent of Jaweena, Chichibu has four smaller island continents. Thracen, in the north polar area, is virtually uninhabited due to its extreme cold, while the equatorial continents of Quillani and Vyrusia boast the majority of the planet's cities, towns and seaports. Uranday, the fourth island continent, is located in the southern hemisphere and is home to the spaceport city of Sharpendale, a major hub for planetary commerce.</Description>

    <Description>Chirikof is the seat of the AFFS� aptly named Chirikof Operation Area (also known as the Edgeward Combat Theater Alpha). It wasn�t colonized until the 24th century, and then only as a mining world. With the help of terraforming technologies, the world became marginally more habitable; farms and ranches were established to ease the burdens on shipping in food, while businesses formed to cater specifically to Chirikof�s small but growing population. As the Federated Suns expanded rimward, the Chirikof system proved to be a key travel hub, prompting national leaders to not only permanently station military forces there to ward away pirates, but also to construct significant travel way-stations at both of the system�s jump points.&#xD; Chirikof remains an important link in the Federated Suns� economy and defense today. The way stations remain incredibly busy, with DropShips coming and going on a continual basis. Cargo of all kinds finds its way into the stations� bays awaiting transfer from one ship to another, all the while generating more revenue for the people of Chirikof in the form of duties and docking fees. The world itself remains a prime mining center, though operations have long since expanded to extract valuable � and plentiful � resources from the other bodies in the system. Of particular value to New Avalon is a prosperous Germanium mining operation on Chirikof II, which has exclusively supplied Galax with the rare and important element for more than two decades now.&#xD; For all these reasons, the Chirikof System remains perpetually abuzz with military forces. While the AFFS does not keep any BattleMech forces permanently assigned here, the Chirikof Operation Area Command Center, located within Fort Chirikof, is home to several active and militia conventional brigades, as well as two marine regiments and a special forces regiment. Likewise, the way-stations host a strong permanent garrison of fighters and military DropShips, ever on the watch for smugglers and pirates, to protect those stations and patrol the system.</Description>

    <Description>[3025] Chukchi III has become an economic and emotional hot spot in recent years. The discovery of massive deposits of titanium have made this quiet and beautiful world the center of several major mining projects. Unfortunately, this sudden economic boom has brought with it unsavory elements such as organized crime. &#xD; It is uncertain whether this small planet's picturesque green valleys and snow-capped mountains can withstand the onslaught of progress. The efforts of the Duke of Chukchi to halt the tide of mining equipment, boom towns, and the millions of foreign employees, have run up against Chukchi's President, who strongly supports the development. &#xD; [3067] Maxell Metals, Incorporated is a branch of the international Maxell Corporation, and a key supplier of personal, industrial and military vehicle-grade laser weapons and other optical components such as holovid scanners and similar products. In addition to the laser factories outside Novaya Kiev, the company also maintains roughly two dozen small mining operations on Chukchi, lured by the discovery of the titanium deposits years earlier.&#xD; These operations have drawn sharp resistance from the natives, many of whom believe their presence is destroying the planetary ecology, decimating local wildlife and drawing in "undesirable elements." The conflict between Chukchi natives eager to embrace the jobs and progress brought by Maxell and other companies, and those vehemently opposed to the "interlopers," has fostered lingering tensions and outright violence for decades, but Maxell's mining and weapons production facilities on Chukchi remain unmoved.</Description>

Defending the world was the First Chupadero Armored Legion, consisting of 11 regiments of armor, 2 mobile infantry regiments and an aerospace wing. The Aerospace Trinary, 214th Jaguar Dragoons, decimated the antiquated fighters sent against them, quickly winning air superiority and buying the Assault Trinary time to hunt down the rest of the planet�s defenders at their leisure.&#xD; The Legion set 'Mech traps all over the floor of Dale Valley, but the Jaguar 'Mechs stepped over most of them and broke the tank regiment's ranks as it retreated. The battered remnant of the defenders entered the nearby Billoc Tunnels, through which they intended to return to the capital city of Fresdin and make a last-ditch stand. Rather than wait for the Legion to come out of hiding, Star Captain Wesley Moon took his unit into the tunnels and destroyed all of the First Legion's remaining vehicles.&#xD; [3059] In one of the only major aerospace conflicts between the Nova Cats and the DCMS during Operation Bulldog, the fighter star of the Fifteenth Garrison Cluster clashed with fighters from the Forty-Second Galedon regulars over the world of Chupadero. At one point in the battle, after Star Captain Joilet shot down Chu-sa Don Magnusson's fighter, it looked as if the Fifteenth might win. However, the rest of the wing rallied around their lost commander and drove the remaining OmniFighters from the sky.</Description>

Rumors abound of secret bases and training facilities in the northern deserts, where it is said that the Circinians have collected an abundance of material looted from Steiner and Marik worlds.&#xD; During the Amaris Civil war, many citizens of the five Houses left to join with Kerensky. Many volunteers had been soldiers and officers in the House militaries who risked court-martial or even summary execution for going AWOL. Some MechWarriors and Aerospace Pilots escaped with their vehicles. The unexpected response deeply moved General Kerensky and the rest of the SLDF. The General gladly accepted these 'Loyalists' as they came to be known, into his army. Even the very old and very young were given tasks to keep the SLDF supplied and fit.&#xD; He even managed to set up a makeshift MechWarrior school on Circinus, a former colony of the Rim Worlds Republic, where he trained many of the Loyalists to pilot 'Mechs in the years 2768 to 2772. These Loyalists eventually formed light 'Mech units, equipped with 'Mechs secretly purchased from Lyran and Marik factories. In their 'Mechs decorated with the royal purple stripes, the Loyalists served with great distinction as reconnaissance units in the war, though their casualties were always amongst the highest.</Description>

The Trinity worlds bore the brunt of these raids, the most significant of which was against Sierra. Although considered outsiders by the native population, the Fifth Oriente Hussars fought valiantly despite the dishonorable tactics employed by the invaders. A counter-raid against Clayborne II that leveled several military facilities (and the palace of a petty lord) convinced the Circinians to cut back on their attacks.&#xD; As the Federated Commonwealth fed unit after unit into the meat grinder of the Clan Invasion, individuals began to realize that following their orders was effectively a death sentence. Several soldiers ordered to the front banded together and fled to the Periphery. Calling themselves �Reed�s Brew� after their commander, Burly Reed (and his legendary affinity for alcohol), this handful of deserters made their way to the Circinus Federation, where they immediately found work bolstering the Black Warriors.&#xD;  The Brew was happy for the most part with their assignment to Clayborne II, with the sole difficulty being the lack of adequate beer. Quite vocal about this drawback, Burly Reed was finally told by one of his many bartenders in 3056 that if he was not satisfied, he should go and brew his own � which is exactly what Reed did.&#xD; By 3060, �Reed�s Beer Brew� had become the most purchased beer in the Circinus Federation. Though still legally under contract to the Federation, Reed�s mercenaries became more of a corporate entity, providing security to Reed�s own massive brewery and the nearby cities at their leisure and enlisting more soldiers to protect their modest facilities elsewhere.</Description>

    <Description>Claybrooke lies on the edge of the Periphery between the Magistracy of Canopus and the Duchy of Andurien. Dame Catherine Humphreys is known to covert Claybrooke for its ranch and dairy products, as well as its natural gas and fossil fuel. She appears to be using the proximity of the Magistracy to put pressure on the leaders of Claybrooke to join the Duchy, offering favorable tariffs and other economic incentives.&#xD; The military dictator of Claybrooke, Lieutenant Colonel Carla Chestine, is having none of it, however. She has political problems of her own, including arguments over mineral development of Claybrooke�s two moons that have begun to resemble the arguments between the Liberals and Expansionists of old Terra. In fact, Chestine is using the threat of an Andurien takeover to hold her dictatorship together, as it is the one issue on which everyone on Claybrooke agrees.&#xD; [3067] The military occupation of Claybrooke in the 3030s galvanized its population, and the Andurien troops who viewed the world as vital bridge to their allies in Canopus suddenly found themselves targets of a vicious resistance. The quisling military dictator, Charles Applebaum, installed by the Humphreys after annexation, found himself ostracized by his own people and forced to reside almost entirely within his fortified mansion in the capital, Sheridan, while Andurien troops ran roughshod over the population. Applebaum�s tenure lasted only eleven months before the anti-Andurien Army of the Resistance shot and then hanged him. &#xD; Headed by former dictator Carla Chestine, the Army waged a guerrilla campaign in the lowlands of the Hastings continent and the Muranga Hills of Hawthorne that kept several regiments of secessionist troops pinned down for almost three years. The resistance group�s almost single-handed victory earned them great plaudits when the FWLM finally liberated the world as part of the ongoing effort to isolate and recapture the errant Andurien Province. Unfortunately for Claybrooke, Chestine sided with Duncan Marik and led a detachment to Xanthe III in support of the short-lived Captain-General. There, she and the core of her Army of the Resistance perished in an ill-planned assault on Andurien positions.&#xD; Chestine�s successors lacked her drive and determination, but managed nonetheless to trade on the Army�s martial success. Several books and films about the locals� resistance to occupation have generated publicity that helps to sell a broad range of Claybrooke�s products throughout the FWL. Claybrooke-brand cheese and beef is commonplace in League food outlets, and a line of �Claybrooke Frontierwear� became a popular trend in the late 3040s. More recently, political debates over farm subsidies for Hastings and the Ermine Archipelago, as well as long-running disputes over the rich petrochemical and mineral deposits on the moons Brana and Kurna, have plagued the tenure of current planetary ruler Colonel Durant. Durant is reputed to have said he would prefer a new invasion to the present situation: �At least then I�d be able to shoot my enemies.�</Description>

This conflict has its roots in the fact that the planet's original settlers were a boatload of convicts who had been brought to Cogdell from a Periphery world and dumped there without food or water. The convicts managed to survive and formed their own culture, a semi-anarchy where each citizen had the right to do as he wished and no one had the right to stop him. When the Federated Suns absorbed Cogdell just before the start of the Third Succession War, the Davion government chose a member of the Sims family, a famous native clan, as ruling Marquess. Since then, the Sims family has gradually adopted a more and more pro-Federated and pro-nobility attitude. The public of Cogdell now believes that the Davion government is a threat to their anarchistic way of life. The friction has even erupted recently into open fighting.&#xD; Cogdell is a beautiful world covered by lush forests, pastures, and thousands of acres of arable land, which yield substantial crops of grains and vegetables. Cogdell exports most of this bounty to nearby worlds, but the recent civil war has damaged this land and disrupted trade.

During the years between 3031 and 3051 alone, over 300 sorties were flown by the Red Skull Legion pirate band against the company�s airships. The band was located somewhere on Cohagen, as evidenced by the Legion�s dominant usage of conventional fighters. Though the planetary government hired several mercenary outfits to protect their Eckener convoys and root out the Red Skull, they were never successful. The attacks faded after 3057, with the company speculating that the pirate leader, Genghis �Khan� Tolson, had died during a particularly disastrous raid against the Pacifica. &#xD; Esso-Xenon had recently hired a new corporate security mercenary band � Blake Security Aviation � and Harris �Paladin� Blake had set out to trap the Legion with the explosives-laden Pacifica. When the majority of the Legion had drawn close, the Pacifica detonated, taking eight Mechbuster fighters to the ground with it�and, presumably, Khan Tolson. The Red Skulls never mounted another&#xD;organized raid again, lending credence to Paladin Blake�s assertion that Tolson had been killed. Esso-Xenon was not magnanimous in victory, though. Until it sees Tolson�s body, the company is withholding the ten million D-bill bonus.&#xD; [3067] Units of the Islamabad CMM�s Second Battalion were engaging in field maneuvers � and a goodwill tour of sorts � along the rimward border of the Islamabad Combat region in the spring when their First and Third Companies found themselves in the middle of an apparent pirate raid on Cohagen. It was later learned that Colonel Teresa Daniels had in fact led a mixed battalion of her inexperienced Third Taurian Lancers on a �bloodying� mission, expecting to find only the planetary militia in place.&#xD; The battle for Cohagen between equally inexperienced forces out of their depths quickly devolved into a series of missteps and overreactions which would have been comic but for the extensive collateral damage to the civilian infrastructure. Daniels made an error that could have been tragic when she mistook a Hindi Ashram for a concealed military base and ordered a strike in force.&#xD; Neither Leftenant Patel nor any of her lance had ever been in combat, but nonetheless, with no backup available they took position astride the narrow valley leading to the commune. In two hours of furious fighting, they held the mixed company at bay until Daniels discovered her error and recalled them. Leftenant Patel accounted for two Plainsmen tanks, a Vindicator, and a Guillotine.</Description>

The Fourth Avalon Hussars were in deep trouble on Colia. Cut off from the rest of its force, the unit became isolated on a small continent where the Kuritans had concentrated many of their forces. Unable to hold a position long enough for evacuation, the 'Mech regiment had been on the run for three weeks, with two Kurita 'Mech regiments now closing in.&#xD; Trapped finally in a dead-end valley, the commander of the Hussars realized that he and his men were probably facing their last battle. They were surrounded by mountains, and they could see the dust of 'Mechs approaching through the only pass. The one odd thing was the absence of Kurita fighters making their lives hell from the air. Yet the fight never came, and the approaching columns of smoke seemed to vanish in thin air. As the Hussars cautiously moved forward, they saw half a regiment of Kurita 'Mechs standing idle while Techs worked frantically in the innards of the metal beasts.&#xD; Not ones to pass up an opportunity, the Hussars attacked immediately, leaving the Kuritans stunned and with their numbers decimated. When the Hussars interrogated some of the survivors about what had stopped their advance, they heard a true military horror story.&#xD; Apparently, a snafu in procurement had resulted in the unit receiving radiation shielding intended for tanks rather than 'Mechs. The Techs had no choice but to try to adapt the shielding for the unit's machines. The shielding proved not only inappropriate, but was of such a poor grade that it disintegrated after rough usage had compromised the 'Mechs' cooling systems, forcing them to completely shut down. A similar mix-up had also kept the Kurita air support from doing its job. The Davion officers did not know what to make of this account, for the Kuritans had often turned the provision of supplies into a veritable military art.</Description>

    <Description>[3050] The 25th Arcturan Guards arrived on Colmar already tired from heavy fighting in the Clan Wolf invasion corridor to meet the Seventh Falcon Talon, in August 3050. A second-line Cluster, the Seventh were fresh from garrison duty. The Jade Falcon Khans decided that in order to catch up to Clan Wolf's rate of conquest, they would bring second-line forces to the front and risk losing a battle or two. The Seventh defeated the 25th Arcturan's, but their fighter pilots bungled a deep-space interception that would have annihilated the surviving enemy force. The Seventh's overall performance pleased the Khans.&#xD; The capital city of Colmar is Doren.&#xD; [3064] During the Falcon Incursion, Khan Vladimir Ward's Wolves attempted to make inroads into the Falcon's Occupation Zone. The 21st Wolf Regulars hit Colmar during December 3064, and managed to force the Falcon's 51st Garrison Cluster offworld, though both sides suffered heavy casualties. Unlike the Coventry Campaign of seven years previously, Khan Marthe Pryde was ready for a Wolf attack into her OZ and had troops in reserve.&#xD; The First Falcon Striker, 7th Talon, Turkina Eyrie and 73rd Striker Clusters landed on Colmar during early June 3065, and by the end of the month forced the 21st Regulars to retreat with serious losses.</Description>

In the long and complex path taken by federal tax money, there comes a point when the vast wealth actually becomes the property of the Davion family. This has given them the unprecedented power to restrict or even stop the flow of money and services to any section of the realm that might somehow displease the Prince. &#xD; The Davions have used this economic cudgel only sparingly, however. Its first use, during the Freedom Rebellion on Colorado in 2609, was so effective that the threat of economic isolation is usually more than enough to bring a balky planet into line.&#xD; [3067] Basantapur Fine Metals, who specialize in the production of rare alloys, have massive germainium strip-mining operation on Colorado.</Description>

In 2565, Roger Varney, aided by a small Capellan squadron, crossed the border and attempted to rally supporters on Carmacks. Though he raised a fairly large militia force, they were no match for Davion regulars, particularly since the Capellan WarShips were annihilated in the Battle of Kigamboni in late 2565. &#xD; This halted Roger�s advance on New Syrtis, where he had hoped to gain massive support from long-time Varney supporters. The Davion �Mechs of the Eighth Syrtis Fusiliers caught him in a retreat to the frontier, destroying Varney�s force almost to a man. Though Roger escaped to keep his cause alive in exile amongst the Capellans, his military support was gone. Eventually his political support would wane as well.&#xD; When the Federated Suns formally joined the Star League in 2567, Prince Davion insisted that economic sanctions be placed on the Confederation for harboring the Varneys in exile. Under this pressure, Chancellor Ursula Liao compromised her position regarding the exiles. Though she would not surrender them to Alexander, she would no longer grant them any special government protection or treat their whereabouts as a state secret. Without guarantees of Liao protection, the Varneys decided to escape, leaving behind their court-in-exile and fat Capellan pensions.</Description>

During the Succession Wars, KIC continued to make parts for its primary products � the Ostsol, Ostscout and Black Knight BattleMech lines � and provided basic factory overhauls and refits for them. &#xD; When new technologies began to re-emerge in the League during the late 3040s, Kong, as a major refit agency, became involved in their deployment, providing field upgrades of its Ost- designs. (The number of Black Knights left in service by that time was deemed too small to warrant a new model, though KIC did assist efforts to restore several designs to their original Star League configuration.)&#xD; Over the past decade, Kong�s fortunes have increased further from the revenues raised by company refit operations, first with the 3058 re-opening of Kong�s IndustrialMech plant at Ranelagh and then with the completion in 3065 of a production line at Shellig for new Ostsols, beginning with the new 7M variant. Plans for a new Ostscout line remain on track for a 3070 opening, with the first runs already sold in advance to the FWLM.</Description>

The Honor Guard went as far as to poison the general water supply, wrongly assuming that the Bears did not have their own reserves.&#xD; The Ghost Bears labeled the Honor Guard dezgra after this incident; Star Colonel Chou Vong used it as an excuse to call down his entire 68th Striker Cluster, and finish the battle quickly.

The 68th chased the Honor Guard�s elite armor regiments for five days, whittling down their forces through attrition.&#xD; [3067] During the Combine / Ghost Bear War, half of the Second Sword of Light launched a daring strike on Constance to pull some Dominion troops back.

    <Description>When first settled, Corridan IV promised colonists an abundance of raw materials and fertile lands, but posed just one small problem: the entire planet's water table was tainted by heavy metals and infested with native bacteria that rendered every living thing on the planet, from plants to animals, toxic for human consumption. Faced with starvation and the failure of their colony, the first settlers initially relied on ice ships, such as those of the Ryan Cartel.&#xD; Eventually Gabriel Tal, a resident part-time chemical engineer, stumbled upon a means to purify over ninety-five percent of the toxic agents from small quantities of Corridani water in a safe and economical fashion using an innovative fusion filtration system. Tal's invention ultimately became the basis for Water Pure Industries, which would become the largest of the Lyran Commonwealth's five water purifier manufacturers.&#xD; Though publicly traded, Water Pure remained mostly in Tal family hands throughout its history, expanding to add manufacturing sites on Freedom and Ryde, and distribution sites on over a dozen worlds in the Federation of Skye. The main plant on Corridan IV has been destroyed five times during the Succession Wars, only to be rebuilt slightly bigger and better each time.&#xD; The value of clean, drinkable water obviously made Corridan IV a prime target during the Succession Wars, and for centuries its cities and the landscape on all three of its primary continents - Alorran and Cederban in the northern hemisphere, Fayrun in the southern - bore the scars of repeated raids and planetary assaults.&#xD; Today, Corridan's greatest exports, after water purifiers, are agricultural and ranching produce, which range from native fruits and vegetables to the beeflike meat of the Corridani grazer, a dim-witted beast roughly half again the size of a Terran buffalo. For this reason, many travelers expect a world of mainly rural plains.&#xD; In fact, close to half the planetary population lives in big cities, mostly concentrated on Feyrun and Cederban. The largest of these, Rio Grande, is home to Water Pure Industries, much of the Tal family fortune, and the largest planetary spaceport. The planetary capital, New Austin, is over seventy kilometers north of Rio Grande, and boasts the planet's largest shipping concern, Corridani Forward, which uses its own starport.</Description>

    <Description>Coventry is a pleasant, heavily industrialized world of large seas and mild seasons. Because of the favorable climate, the earlier settlers had soon turned Coventry into a major agricultural center for the Lyran worlds near the Periphery. Though it is an agricultural center to this day, the eventual discovery of major deposits of rare metals has also made the planet an industrial center.&#xD; Coventry Metal Works, the second-largest BattleMech company in the Commonwealth, is located here. The discovery of another major deposit of rare metals a decade ago set off a new surge of growth in Coventry's economy. The number of native corporations in and around the cities on the planet's four continents has tripled in the last ten years. At the moment, these firms have not branched out into the larger Commonwealth market, but some like McKenzy Molecular Smelters and Greenbil Aerospace, seem on the verge of doing so.&#xD; Coventry's continents are named Veracruz, Dunnigan and Chakulas. Coventry Metal Works and Port St. William, Coventy's largest city, are situated on the largest continent of Veracruz.&#xD; [3025] The largest computer company in the Commonwealth, Nashan Computers makes computers that rival in complexity the best ComStar craftsmen can make. How they manage to build computers of Star League capability when other Commonwealth manufacturers can barely turn out computers of late 25th century technology is a mystery. The five Nashan Computers factories are located on Coventry.&#xD; [3062] Originally known simply as the Coventry Academy, the Coventry Military Academy has never been a large school. The damage sustained in Clan Jade Falcon's 3058 attack might have been far more injurious, except for the actions of cadets and instructors alike. When the academy was attacked, they fought a bitter engagement against the invaders in the grounds of the academy itself. The defenders deliberately destroyed several buildings to prevent the structures from falling into Clan hands before they themselves were taken as bondsmen, only to be released when the Falcons withdrew.&#xD; To reward the heroism of the cadets and instructors, Archon Katherine ordered that no expense be spared in rebuilding the academy. The rebuilding commenced almost immediately, but still took almost two years to be completed. During that time, surviving cadets were transferred to the Nagelring or to active service. The classes currently being educated at the academy are taught about the exploits of their predecessors and make use of new, state0of-the-art training equipment. The first class of the reformed Coventry Academy is scheduled to graduate in the summer of 3063.&#xD; Leutnant-General Billie Piper, formerly an instructor at the Nagelring, commands the CMA.</Description>

Immediately dispatching a DropShip, the captain ordered the system explored. The expedition found the planet to be rich with precious metals, stones, rare metals and vast petroleum deposits. The soil, on the other hand, was nitrogen poor, laced with minerals that would support few crops. The ship's owner Johansson Solberg, submitted a claim for the planet, with colonization on Crimond beginning shortly thereafter.&#xD; Crimond has three continents, of which two have been settled and their resources exploited. On Metallerz, the largest continent, all the metal ore mines and petroleum fields are operational, including the goldmines at Vertorrous. Chromatisch is the home of one of the largest diamond mines in the Alliance. The planet's capital, Sol City, was founded on the southern coast.&#xD; The standard of living on Crimond rivals some of the province capitals, including Tharkad, although its population is highly dependent on imports for food. The island continent of Condor is home to the former Star League base Fort Beaufort, which is still used today. Fort Beaufort was home to the SLDF's Fifty-Forth Mechanized Infantry Division, a unit that disappeared after the Amaris War. Condor is a mountainous desert island that has never been settled by civilians. The LAAF has classified the island off-limits.&#xD; [3053] Believed destroyed or captured by Clan Wolf on Domain and Rastaban, the Federated Commonwealth was surprised when a small contingent of The Knights of St. Cameron arrived at Crimond in March 3053. Led by Colonel Mortimer Dewey, the son of former commander Felix Dewey, the survivors sent out a call for new recruits. Despite the unit's dire situation, the Colonel insisted on the continuation of the Knight's original policy of only recruiting troops whose families had served with the original SLDF.</Description>

    <Description>[3067] Headquartered on Menke in the Capellan Confederation and with operations in four of the five Successor States, Starcorps Industries is likely the largest � and most heavily regulated � military industry in the Inner Sphere today. Since the company first offered the Warhammer over 500 years ago, it has remained at the forefront of advancement. During the Federated Commonwealth era, Starcorps� factories in the Federated Suns � based at Farrarrah on Crofton � and those in the Lyran Commonwealth and St. Ives Compact all saw significant upgrades, increasing production capacity and quality. Of course, those advancements could not be released to the company�s Capellan and League divisions � though scores of corporate officers and employees were tried and convicted for attempting just that � ensuring that those four factories would remain the best and most profitable (FWL facilities would ultimately receive similar upgrades during the 3050s). That only deepened the schism already present within the company, leading to more and more infighting.&#xD; Still, the company was able to put aside its internal differences long enough to debut new multi-national designs of both the Warhammer and the Longbow, while the Lyran and FedSuns divisions continue to collaborate in improving the design of the Manteuffel OmniTank, the company�s first foray into designing and building vehicles outside of its St. Ives division.</Description>

Though it began as an agricultural equipment company, Interstellar Harvesters now also produces heavy equipment for other industries such as mining, metalworking, and construction.&#xD; Over-diversification and some mismanagement ran the company into financial trouble in recent years, but a bloodless coup in the executive offices eliminated much of the problem. Anyone calling and asking for Yosi Hikosura, the former company president, is told to try the Naga Monastery, to which Hikosura abruptly retreated.&#xD; [3051] The freebirth warriors of the Choyer and Gurbeng Garrison Clusters had little difficulty defeating the militia of Cusset, when they landed on the world in November 3051. The warriors did, however, face the Cusset Crud, a virulent virus that even the Clans superb medical skills could not fully control.&#xD; [3065] During the Falcon Incursion, Khan Vladimir Ward's Wolves attempted to make inroads into the Falcon's Occupation Zone. Unlike the Coventry Campaign of seven years previously, Khan Marthe Pryde was ready for a Wolf attack into her OZ and had troops in reserve, which she then sent to counterattack the Wolves in their own territory. &#xD; The 124th Striker Cluster landed on Cusset during June 3065, forcing the 20th Wolf Regulars to withdraw, whilst suffering serious damage to themselves.</Description>

    <Description>Cylene II's eccentric orbit is largely attributed to the imbalance caused by the shattering of its large moon into three smaller satellites roughly 80 thousand years ago, likely by a large rogue asteroid or comet. As a result, the planet is currently entering into what many believe to be the beginnings of an ice age, with temperatures near freezing even at the equator during the winter months. &#xD; This, as much as the damage done during the first two Succession Wars (particularly between the Draconis Combine and the Federated Suns), has resulted in the gradual but steady emigration of the population to other, more hospitable and safe worlds nearby. Ruins of cities destroyed or abandoned in the early wars still dot the landscape of the northern continent.&#xD; Only the large deposits of industrial-grade metal ore, discovered close to the planet surface and churned up by the planet's occasionally overactive geology, has kept people around and employed. The planet's main continents are the largely unpopulated Graus in the north, Clytemnestra in the south, and Absalom, a large landmass that practically rings the entire equatorial region and is home to the planetary capital of Halcyon.</Description>

Yanyouan felt confident in his knowledge of Clan equipment and tactics and so expected to give the Nova Cats a run for their money.&#xD; When the Clan attacked in February 3052 without announcing their forces through the batchall, and then used the recently developed Smoke Jaguar tactic of sending the Clan's heaviest 'Mechs to tear up and down the defenders' lines, probing the farthest-flung elements with Striker Trinaries, and strafing the Legion's rear with aerospace assets, the terrified and confused Tai-sa ordered a fighting retreat.&#xD; The Legion pulled back to the coastal city of Lasner and settled in for a siege. The Nova Cats immediately sent their aerospace assets to take out the Legion's long-range artillery, then drove their 'Mechs straight through the defenders and into the heart of the city. Here the Legion infantry finally held the tactical advantage long enough to destroy almost a Trinary's worth of the 179th Striker Cluster's OmniMechs. The First Shin Legion survived to limp offworld.&#xD; [3061] During Operation Bulldog in 3059, the Forth Nova Cat Regulars on Cyrenaica were quickly made abtakha by the First Shin Legion. This should have set the stage for amicable relations between the two units, but it was not to be. Following the end of Operation Bulldog, the First Shin returned to garrison Cyrenaica alongside the Forth Regulars. Remembering their defeat at the hands of the 179th Striker Cluster in February 3052, the First was spoiling for a fight. Tensions exploded in mid 3061, when the First Legion attacked the Forth Regulars. After several days of viscous fighting, both sides withdrew, the Forth having lost two Trinaries.&#xD; Though it was clear the Forth was not to blame for the incident, Khan Santin West moved them to Tarazed in the hope of easing growing tensions between the Nova Cats and the DCMS.</Description>

The company's recent acquisition of one-time competitor Yulers Electronics on Czarvowo has won them a renewal of a lucrative communications service and repair contract with the LAAF, assuring that SeraVideo will dominate the conventional communications field for a long time to come.&#xD; Some of the last Meabh-class heavy cruisers being operated by the LCAF were the&#xD;Sarah Steiner and Stadt Fischingen which provided escort duty on Czarvowo, along with their supporting Cliona-class frigates Cliona, Tethya and Axinella. While the Sarah Steiner and two of the frigates were scrapped, her sister ship became somewhat of a tragic celebrity.&#xD; The Stadt Fischingen � never having been in any notable engagement � still met a violent end. Hijacked right off her museum dock alongside the Cliona by fanatical environmental activists intent on shutting down the underwater command post, she sunk far off the coast under circumstances still unclear.&#xD; Circumstances that might come to light in the near future, as the wreck has recently been rediscovered by deep-sea resource prospectors.

    <Description>Another of the so-called Azami worlds, Dabih was settled by pilgrims of the Muslim faith, who were drawn to the planet's lush forests and large, deep oceans. Shortly after the discovery of the planet, however, came the equally welcome revelation that its large, innermost moon, Shakhi, was also suitable for colonization, possessing a breathable - if thin - atmosphere and enough free-standing water to sustain a limited ecosystem. Finding themselves gifted with two worlds for the price of one, the Azami settled Dabih and Shakhi with equal determination. As Shakhi's delicate environment could not support more than a basic agricultural industry, the newborn Dabih planetary leadership decreed the moon would be the planet's "breadbasket." This freed the planetary-based industries to use more land and resources for heavy manufacturing and mining ventures. &#xD; Unfortunately, neither plan turned out well. Shakhi's soil proved difficult to work and could support only a few grain crops without extensive bioengineering, while many of Dabih's valuable veins of metals and chemicals lay deep within the planet's crust, requiring extreme efforts to locate and exploit. Almost a century after the first cities appeared, however, Dabih's luck changed when a vast, rich vein of crude oil was discovered beneath the frozen lands of Garalash, the southern polar continent. Natural gas pockets, located by offshore mining operations, soon gave the planet a major resource for use in trade with other worlds.&#xD; By the 26th century, Dabih had become a major exporter of refined hydrocarbon fuels, for use in everything from small power generators to heavy aircraft engines. Shakhi, meanwhile, had stagnated, a world of rugged prairies and sparse farmlands, used mainly as a way station between the planet and its jump point. Defending forces assigned to Dabih used the lunar surface as a base of operations for their aerospace elements, a strategy that helped thwart many raids and attempted invasions during the Succession Wars. It even helped the local Azami resist the Combine leadership's efforts to rein in their culture.&#xD; Today, Dabih remains the economic and industrial core of the two-world microcosm, with Shakhi as its quiet guardian overhead. The capital for both worlds is Barheilabad, located on the equatorial continent of Zairikesh on Dabih. Dabih is also home to the primary commercial spaceport city of Kentiles, on the eastern coast of the northern Ludesi continent, the third of Dabih's major landmasses. Shakhi, with far less water than Dabih, is home to the military settlement of Garhenna, on the northern lunar continent of North Shakhiseh. Farmlands dominate much of the southern lunar continent, Jidharo.</Description>

During the single Kurita raid on the planet in 3005, a company of miners defended their stake using the 40-foot tall Brooks Incorporated Three-Man Digging Machines.

    <Description>A beautiful world during the height of the Star League, Dalkeith was turned into a nuclear wasteland during the savagery of the Succession Wars. Of Dalkeith�s three continents, only Dunnbar is remotely habitable. Dunnbar is a large landmass that only barely supports its current population. In 2775, Dalkeith boasted a population over two billion; three centuries later it barely reaches three hundred million. The atmosphere is tainted with high levels of carbon dioxide and micro dust, requiring the use of filtered breathing devices.&#xD; During the First Succession War, House Kurita attacked Dalkeith�s main continent of Rockmeir with over a dozen 100-megaton nuclear weapons, blanketing the continent and destroying the Star League Castle Brian, the planet�s capital of Newhaven, and nearly the entire population. The continent of Devarick was poisoned by more nuclear weapons and chemical attacks against the defending Lyran forces. Dalkeith would have been abandoned entirely had it not been for the planet�s rich resources in radioactive metals and iron-ores that lay beneath Dunnbar�s Alveria mountain range.&#xD; With its close proximity to the Combine border, Dalkeith has been used to stage raids against both the Draconis combine and later the Clans. Though life looks extremely hard to an outsider, the natives have adapted to their surroundings. Native Dalkeithians have a natural resistance to the effects of some types of radiation.</Description>

    <Description>In 2310, the first probe of Dalton found plentiful water, arable land, breathable air, edible lifeforms, and even mammalian lifeforms. It also found a far greater degree of seismic activity than any other planet ever settled. With so many other promising worlds available for colonization, no settlement was established on Dalton. By 2521, when another probe was made, the seismic activity had mysteriously ceased, and so settlers began emigrating there. In the five centuries that humans have lived on Dalton, there has not been a single earthquake.&#xD; As Dalton is governed by a representative commonality, there has been little political upheaval. Part of the reason for this is that the leaders are careful to reward good work in every field. With no one embittered by the greater success than others, there is little basis for discomfort. Unfortunately, this system has produced almost no native art of literature, as such work cannot be fairly evaluated at the time it is produced. Creative artists tend to emigrate the first chance they get.&#xD; There has been a remarkable paucity of celebrities from Dalton, at least among those who choose to remain there. The most famous individual to have come from there was Hilda Lauber, Janos Marik's first wife.&#xD; [3067] Though managed by the Captain-General�s cousin � Mathias Lauber is the grandson of Jerome Lauber, as is Thomas Marik � Garret Satcomm has done little to exploit its relationship with the Atreus Court. Instead, its business in the League and abroad is based solely on the reputation of Garret�s equipment, produced on Dalton at Castleton, which is widely acknowledged as among the finest produced in the Inner Sphere. The addition of ECM, ECCM, active probes and advanced fire-control systems has solidified the company�s position at the pinnacle of the TTS market.  &#xD; Garret has not been satisfied to rest on its laurels, however, and though no products have been released on the open market, the R&amp;D department is working closely with the FWLM to develop a next generation of systems. Garret was closely involved with the miniaturized sensor suites used on the Phalanx battlesuit, as well as the long-range systems employed on some of the League�s newest naval vessels.&#xD; Garret�s homeworld of Dalton has become the company�s latest �macro-scale� project with the installation of a seismic monitoring network. The Neptune Network (named for the Roman god of the sea and earthquakes) is intended to unravel the mystery of Dalton � its reversion to geologic stability around 2500A.D. after years of intense seismic activity. Scientists hope the project will reveal the reason behind the quieting of the world�s geology and also predict whether the intense activity was a solitary event or part of an ongoing cycle. The study, running since 3058, is due to report in the coming months.&#xD; Nimakachi Fusion Products is deeply enmeshed in DropShip manufacture, producing the Octopus tug and Condor troop transport at its Baron on Dalton plant. Third-party corporations produce many of the components used in this process, but the orbiting yards build the spaceframes and interplanetary drives as well as carrying out final assembly. Demand for both models remains high, with the League government the largest purchaser. A civilian version of the Condor, the cargo-carrying Stork-class, is undergoing pre-delivery trials in advance of full-scale production scheduled to commence in 3069.</Description>

The Ghost Bears left a small garrison on the planet, and then moved on. Two months later, the Black Omens came out of hiding and overran the garrison forcing the Bears to retake the planet during the second wave of the invasion. &#xD; The Black Omen's "treachery," as the Ghost Bears see it, accounts for much of that Clan's well-known hatred of mercenaries.&#xD;Grabbing what salvage they could, the Omen sent out a distress signal and finally escaped when DCMS forces landed. However, their �treachery� in hiding from battle only to strike at inferior forces later is said to have sparked much of the Ghost Bears� intense hatred toward mercenaries, which remains to this day.&#xD; [3063] During the Ghost Bear invasion, Captain Smith � now commander of the infamous Black Omen mercenaries - jumped at the opportunity to gain some retribution against their old enemies. In keeping with their contract, they used their creative control in selecting targets and employing tactics. From Wolcott, the Omen secretly penetrated the Dominion and waged a McCarron�s-style campaign against the worlds of Pinnacle, Holmsbu, and Thule, disabling each planet�s HPG and destroying munitions depots along the way.&#xD; The Black Omen struck at Damien where they once again overran a small garrison unit. This time, however, Captain Smith destroyed the Bear�s military depots and repair facilities as well, and captured as much booty as the Omen could carry. For their final act, Captain Smith unfurled a large flag with the Omen�s crest over the capital, leaving the Bears their calling card.</Description>

    <Description>Dante is an agricultural world whose mild climate is ideally suited to the cultivation of grains and other seasonal crops. It was first settled after the First Succession War by waves of Kurita immigrants seeking to begin their lives anew, but has been an unofficially demilitarized planet since the 2800's. The planet currently depends on its stance of global non-violence as protection from raids from other systems. From it simple origins, Dante has evolved into the major cultural center of the Omniss cult, a group based on the rejection of all non-essential technologies in favor of an agrarian social code. Thus have planetary assemblies banned permanent garrisons on Dante for the last 150 years. At present, over 5000 civilians, mostly farm laborers and cottage-industry craftsmen, inhabit Dante. The local government maintains a strict ban against the importation of all technology not directly related to the medical or life sciences. Because of this technology ban, ComStar is not permitted to maintain communication facilities in the Dante system.</Description>

Because of its surface resemblance to the vast desert regions of the Middle East and Northern Africa, from which many of these settlers hailed, they chose this world as their new sanctuary and named it Dar-es-Salaam (�Haven of Peace�). &#xD; Since that time, Dar-es-Salaam has become the de facto center of the Muslim religion within the religiously tolerant Lyran Alliance (nee Commonwealth). The people here follow a simple set of beliefs, as outlined in the Koran, and though strict, their moral emphasis on the family � a great comfort to many Lyrans throughout the centuries of war � has since attracted converts from all across the Lyran state, who see this world as a kind of Mecca.&#xD; Dar-es-Salaam's capital city, Khadijah, is located on the northwestern shore of Mellesse, the massive continent that covers close to sixty percent of the planetary surface, including the south pole and half the equatorial band</Description>

The local population has long since grown immune to the effects of this taint, but visitors to David who plan to do anything that involves eating, drinking, or even swimming in any of the planet's few freshwater lakes must take a series of inoculations in advance, or risk the consequences. &#xD; Over sixty percent of David's surface is claimed by two enormous landmasses known as Andropo and Geronomis, and a host of large islands that ring them. Andropo, with its more fertile soils and lodes of precious metals, is home to most of David's limited farming, which is sufficient enough to support most of the planet's population, as well as some light industry. Geronomis, more equatorial and barren in its central regions, supports a slightly heavier industry and is also home to Polis, David's capital city and major spaceport.&#xD; [3056] The Draconis Combine launched a diversionary raid on David in the 3049. During the raid the ruler of David, Duke Benjamin Absola, lost his mountain retreat because of a Kuritan recon company. Enraged by his loss, the Duke has sworn vengeance. Though the Clan invasion has slowed down his plans momentarily, the duke still seeks revenge against the Kuritans, and rumor has it he is attempting to raise a force to enact his revenge.</Description>

    <Description>Defiance is a backwater world. It has large military support facilities, as it has been used by the FedCom for wargames from time to time. While its atmosphere is not hostile, neither is it pleasant. Few reptilian and avian lifeforms can tolerate the moderate concentrations of sulfur and sulfur dioxides in the atmosphere. Personnel require the use of respirators and filter masks, and all housing on the planet possesses airlocks to allow entry without fouling the interior atmosphere.&#xD; Jerseyville is the capital of Defiance, and also its only spaceport. Situated on the site of the original settlers' first landing, Jerseyville was named after its founder, Malcom Jersey. The city itself is little more than a large cluster of small houses, shops and office buildings huddled in the foothills of the Devil's Backbone mountain range. The settlers, most of them prospectors, had come to Defiance during the early days of the Star League, attracted by the planet's vast mineral wealth. The almost constant eruptions that marked its early life brought up many rare earth elements out of the young planet's core. Transuranic elements are especially common in the now mostly extinct volcanoes of the Backbone mountains. Over the years, the hundreds of small, independent mines were acquired by large corporations, until eventually the greatest portion of the planet was owned outright by Solar Metals Limited, who sold it to the Davion family in 2748. &#xD; The flatlands wedged in between the Pearse Sea to the east and the Devil's Backbone Mountains on the west would be some of the richest farming lands in the Inner Sphere, if not for the taint in the atmosphere. Though the sulfur content is not high enough to prevent plant life from growing, even flourishing, in the black, volcanic soil, it is sufficient to be absorbed into the crops, giving any foodstuffs grown there an unpleasant, bitter taste.</Description>

    <Description>Dehgolan - Canaris III - is that rarity among planetary subtypes, a true jungle planet. It's surface area is evenly divided between low-lying landmasses and shallow, stagnant seas. It has no axial tilt to produce seasonal variation and it possesses a dense, fetid atmosphere, which evenly distributes the heat it receives from Canaris. Under these conditions, most of Dehgolan's land area, excepting the desert uplands and open plains at the poles, is covered in dense, impenetrable jungle.&#xD; Dehgolan's cities, clustered along the shores of several of the world's seas, rely heavily on fishing and water-born transport. The interior is a place where few people care to visit. There are countless tales of life forms - large, vicious, and very, very hungry - which inhabit the deep jungle.&#xD; People have investigated the interior, however, and those who have returned have done so using BattleMechs. Dehgolan is a prime example of lengths to which natural selection can go to produce life forms efficient at survival. Whatever the truth behind the tales of truly enormous jungle creatures, much of the planet's native life is vicious with a bloodthirsty single-mindedness difficult for offworlder humans to understand. BattleMechs, at least, give humans an even chance when they venture into Dehgolan's interior.</Description>

    <Description>[2581] When the Star League resumed the Taurian campaign of the Reunification War, in late 2581, the target was the world of Deifenbaker. Anti-partisan units dropped behind Taurian lines began to engage rival bands of commandos for possession of key communications centers and transportation nexus points. When the final assault began in December, the local Concordat commander, General Illicia Braxton, consolidated her forces in the forbidding Corigan hills overlooking the Deifenbaker capital. &#xD; The battle of Corigan was one of the few infantry-vs-infantry campaigns of the war, for the rough terrain precluded 'Mech operations. After suffering more than 5,000 casualties, the elite 88th Light Horse reached the summit of the Taurian defensive position, only to find that the remaining 400 Taurians had committed suicide.&#xD; [2585] Responding to the new Terran scorched-earth policy, Mitchell Calderon designed a bold plan to relieve pressure on his remaining garrisons scattered beyond the Hyades Cluster. Calling upon his three Household BattleMech regiments, the Taurian Guard, The Concordat Velites, and the Calderon Red Hand, he launched an attack against the Terran Third Corps on Deifenbaker. The result was the largest �Mech-vs-�Mech engagement of the entire war. More and more troops from outlying regions were funneled into the fight, which raged between February and June.&#xD; In the end, all but 50 of the Concordat BattleMechs were eliminated at a cost of over three hundred of the Star League's 'Mechs. The second battle for Deifenbaker was a pyrrhic victory for the Star League. Though the League could boast of having broken the back of the Concordat armed forces, it has paid dearly with the blood of its most experienced MechWarriors.</Description>

Headquartered at Williams Bay on Delavan, one of the Federated Suns� Golden Worlds and a mere jump away from the seat of power, Universal Air is not only well protected but is able to draw upon the best resources available in the Federated Suns. As one of the Inner Sphere�s few surviving manufacturers of JumpShips, not to mention the two most sought-after JumpShip designs still constructed, it wields an incredible amount of financial and political power.&#xD; Its CEO can have friends and relatives elevated to high positions within the government, can all but dictate prices to the AFFS, and can even influence national policy � which included a significant role in the design and construction of the Federated Suns� WarShip fleet. Divisions on both Galax and Kathil not only construct the WarShips� compact K-F Drives, but also a significant portion of each ship. Of course, the power that Universal Air wields comes at a price � the First Prince has, more than once in the past, removed every corporate officer from power and replaced them with individuals considered more loyal to the nation and the Davion family. &#xD; Also located on Delavan, with its headquarters situated at Como, Dynamico Ltd. has its origins in two companies founded in the 25th century to produce DropShips for the Federated Suns. Merging into Dynamico Ltd. at the height of the Star League, it continued to produce the same products with the same high quality. In the tumult of the 29th century Dynamico purchased ExoStar Laser Technologies, another Delavan-based manufacturer that languished when a series of fulfilled but unpaid-for Star League contracts left the company bankrupt. AFFS orders during the Succession Wars kept the company not only solvent but also quite profitable.&#xD; The Avenger- and Buccaneer-class DropShips are Dynamico Aerospace Systems� most notable products, though it also builds a number of different models of civilian aerospace craft, as well as several new DropShip models that have yet to reach wide use (such as the Aurora class developed in conjunction with Shipil Company of Skye). ExoStar Laser Technologies specializes in designing and manufacturing advanced laser weaponry, including several licensed lines, for the Federated Suns� military industry.</Description>

Khan Ulric Kerensky did not intend to strike at the megaplex though. Instead his forces hung back just outside of the Guards� defensive positions, skirmishing with the defenders.&#xD; Though this did not seriously weaken the defenders� equipment or supplies, the psychological pressure proved overwhelming. Marshal Shremp finally abandoned her fortifications in an attempt to destroy the Golden Keshik and the Forth Wolf Guards. The majority of the proud Arcturan Guards met their fate in Mercer Valley, which the Wolves had mined with vibrabombs. This action marked one of the few instances in which Clan forces used such weapons. The mines, combined with interlocking kill zones, produced a carnage from which few of the Lyrans escaped.</Description>

Some of these ships were of a design not seen in nearly two centuries, and were fully loaded with combat DropShips - Overloads, Unions, Leopards, and even a few of the old Lion class.&#xD; With enough transport for five full BattleMech regiments, the convoy created panic among the small Davion garrison on Delos. The panic on Delos only subsided when the leader of the convoy sent a message to the planet instead of attacking. Identifying himself as Colonel Jamie Wolf, the leader stated that he had come in peace with his Dragoons to seek employment with Prince Ian Davion.</Description>

Where naturally occurring crystalline formations - some reportedly over a kilometer in diameter - grew on the continent of Shallahandra, the ground is now covered with ferrocrete and heavy construction. &#xD; Since the fall of the Star League, Demeter has been used to stage many assaults against the Capellan Confederation. The fruits of that continued aggression proved deadly to Demeter's inhabitants, however, when on a warm spring day in May 2760, a series of atomic blasts destroyed the BattleMech and Aerospace production plants of Lycomb-Davion IntraTech. The blast also decimated nearly a thousand square kilometers of Ulreich, the smallest of Demeter's three continents.&#xD; For three centuries, it was believed that this area of Ulreich was uninhabitable. A recent inspection of the site revealed that the radiation had dropped to acceptable levels and, backed by the Duke of Demeter, Vicore Industries broke ground on a new industrial complex near the old site. Nine years to the day, the first lines were activated and began producing a series of electronics and mechanical equipment. The planetary capital of New Demeter City, On Demeter's largest continent of Bolan, houses the company's home offices, however.&#xD; [3062] During a recent training mission in Demeter's Kuriak Mountains, the Fifth Crucis Lancers RCT lost contact with their Second and Third battalions. After three days, General Richardson dispatched a recon force from the 204th Scout. A day later he led four regiments into the mountains, where he found all his missing equipment but the remains of only a few of the 204th's soldiers.

    <Description>A fairly dry world, with deserts covering more than two-thirds of its surface land, Deneb Algedi wasn't exactly seen as a paradise when it was discovered in the first century of mankind's ascent to the stars. However, colonists from Terra's African and South American continents, desperate to escape the oppression of the Terran government, eagerly made for the water-poor planet, determined to build a life of their own. &#xD; Unfortunately, the first surveys of Deneb Algedi, which were conducted by remote drones, did not take into account the planet's dominant life form: the aggressive nayaraptor. This territorial airborne predator, with a wingspan of almost two meters and the strength to snatch up prey weighing as much as 90 kilograms, was dubbed "sky shark" by the locals. The nayaraptor, which hunts singly, pounced upon many of the first settlers, who soon learned their only defense lay in large numbers, preferably armed.&#xD; As the colonists built the first towns and cities on Deneb Algedi, organized hunts for the nayaraptor gradually changed from a necessity to a sport. Though still a dangerous beast, the nayaraptor is now the focus of a thriving game industry. Travelers looking for a safari still visit this world to hunt the deadly nayaraptor on its home soil, particularly on the island continent of Ombanwe, where the local government has apportioned out several giant hunting ranges.&#xD; Located in Deneb Algedi's equatorial region, Ombanwe also boasts the largest tracts of open deserts and dried-out river basins, the favored terrain of the nayaraptor, and Hunter's Den, a resort city on the southeastern coast, the continent's only major human settlement. The large, mountainous supercontinent of Librios, located east of Ombanwe and stretching almost from pole to pole, is home to most of Deneb Algedi's main cities and the bulk of the planetary population. The capital city, Nueva Santiago, sits in a lush river valley on the northwestern edge of this landmass, just a few dozen kilometers from San Luerdes, a sprawling commercial city that also boasts the planet's largest DropPort. &#xD; The remainder of Deneb Algedi's landmass is claimed by the Batambu Chain, a series of six large islands that trace a rough line from Librios' southeast peninsula to Ombanwe's western shores. Few live on the mostly dry and rocky Batambu Chain, but the planetary defense forces maintain several installations, barracks and weapons test ranges there.</Description>

    <Description>An unremarkable, small world blanketed by grasslands and tundra, Deneb Kaitos was originally settled by the Terran Hegemony. The world is most famous as being the home of the renowned Deneb Light Cavalry. At the height of the Star League, the Regular Army boasted a group of �Mech regiments whose ability to respond quickly, anywhere they were needed was legendary. These quick-response troops were officially known as the Rapid Deployment Mixed Arm Forces, or RDMAF. The general public, however, knew these elite troops � because of several highly romanticized holoplays � as the Deneb Light Cavalry, after the headquarters of the RDMAF on Deneb Kaitos and the pony on their banners.&#xD; When the Star League collapsed, only one RDMAF unit refused General Kerensky's orders and stayed on Deneb Kaitos. The Fourth Deneb Light Cavalry was commanded by General Eveline McDennis, who firmly believed it would be an act of cowardice to abandon the Inner Sphere. Her original intention was to remain on Deneb Kaitos to protect that world somehow from the warfare that was sure to come. As trade to the world collapsed and the population began to starve, General McDennis was forced to consider offers of employment from all five Successor Lords.&#xD; After hearing them out, McDennis replied that she and her men would work for whichever House could guarantee that the people of Deneb Kaitos would have food until they could grow enough on their own. It was a condition that only the Federated Suns would accept. As the desperately needed shipments of food and agricultural equipment made their way to Deneb Kaitos, the Fourth Deneb Light Cavalry packed up and prepared to become part of the AFFS.&#xD; Deneb Kaitos has remained under House Davion's banner except for a brief period of Capellan occupation during the Third Succession War. Although the makeup of the Deneb Light Cavalry eventually reflected that of all Federated Suns worlds, men and women who grew up in Deneb Kaitos's rugged sheepherding lifestyle continued to be the Cavalry's most ardent and effective MechWarriors. The continent of Baten is home to the capital of Cetus and is located in the northern hemisphere; the continents of Menkar and Mira straddle the equator.&#xD; Deneb Light Cavalry Regimental Combat Teams are organized slightly different than other RCTs in the Federated Suns. Around the one 'Mech regiment, which usually has light to medium 'Mechs, there are two hovercraft regiments and two jump infantry regiments. Also, there are three times the normal number of AeroSpace Fighters present, plus enough DropShips and JumpShips to transport them.&#xD; The Deneb Light Cavalry has always preferred to use a light tan paint scheme to show their pride in their Regular Army roots, even when other units would adopt camouflage paint schemes. The Deneb Light Cavalry insignia is a rectangle of black surrounding the bust of a white horse upon a square of gold. The unit number is written in roman numerals within the golden square. Most of the units are named after swift predators.</Description>

    <Description>Denebola V, known to its inhabitants as either Everwood or Lyracropis, is a cool world with untouched woodlands covering almost eighty percent of its equatorial and tropical zones. The three giant landmasses of Neurasia, Zadipos, and Slovakia, which straddle these regions, are home to most of the planetary population, which established its cities along the winding rivers that cut through the forested lands. The northern and southern regions, by comparison, are virtually devoid of life, as polar caps extend well into the temperate zones, retreating ever so slowly at what experts believe is the receding edge of a planetary ice age. &#xD; When this world was first settled, Denebola's ice caps reached as far as the northern tropical latitudes, and the early colonists considered various means of terraforming the world to open more land up for farming. Time and economics, however, were not conducive to such a venture, as the faltering Terran Alliance attempted to assert its authority over the independent-minded settlers. Denebola V was the first of the early Terran colonies to declare its independence from the Alliance, and successfully repelled that ill-fated government's efforts to bring its population in line. This independence would be short-lived, however. &#xD; Virtually isolated after securing their freedom, the inhabitants of Denebola soon found themselves forced to rely on loose trading alliances with various local systems for badly needed equipment to survive on their cold world, an ironic result of Terra's sudden shift toward isolationism. Disease and poorly executed agricultural programs added to the planet�s woes, and several early settlements died out completely, resulting in a fractured population as local communications broke down. Two separate colonial groups survived, one on the frosty northern reaches of Zadipos, the eastern continent, and the other on the hilly, river-crossed land of Neurasia in the central equatorial zones. Both colonial settlements presumed the others were lost as central government collapsed on Denebola, until years later, when the ascendance of the Terran Hegemony brought Denebola back into touch with the rest of the galactic community. &#xD; The arrival of the Hegemony, and the Star League after that, saved the Denebolans from the brink of oblivion, but those who remained were some of the hardiest and most stubborn of the planet�s population, adapted to years of living and forging a living in relative isolation. The trouble came when the Hegemony attempted to help the locals establish a central authority for the planet, as the Zadipos and Neurasian peoples each claimed the right to self-rule. A series of compromises averted what looked like the onset of a brushfire war on Denebola, as the Hegemony brokered the formation of a confederation-style government. &#xD; Allowing each of the two populations to see to its own affairs, while representatives from each made planetary-level decisions using an as-needed planetary council forum. This loose confederation and dual-government state evolved into a more homogeneous combination and centralized government after the fall of the Star League, as Denebola, lying right on the border of the Lyran Commonwealth and the Free Worlds League, changed ownership a number of times through the centuries. The resulting influx of off-world immigrants with each change of hands, mixed with the planet's past as a dual-society world, has resulted in a cosmopolitan melting pot.&#xD; Today, Denebola still maintains capital cities for each of its continents. Zadipos' capital, Fallen Star, is nestled on the western cost and is home to a thriving fishing community and regional defense post, while New Bonn covers the entire northern edge of the large inland Lake Diamond on Neurasia, and maintains several prime logging and farming industries. The official planetary capital, St. Cameron, is located on the eastern Rhyde Peninsula of Slovakia, and is home to Denebola's largest spaceport.</Description>

    <Description>Deshler is a water world, with seas covering 80% of its surface. The seas are so laded with reddish algae that they sometimes resemble bloodied waters. The rugged continents are places of rocky hills, thick lowland jungles, and windswept crags.&#xD; It possesses two 'Mech factories: the damaged Aghama 'Mechworks facility in the Aghama valley, and a second plant at Valerian Bay.&#xD; [2621] Though the economies of the six member states prospered under the Department of Economic Relations, it was not enough for First Lord Nicholas Cameron. Following his father's vision, Nicholas announced in 2621 his intention to finish uniting the member states' economies by creating the Star League Dollar. This became the standard currency everywhere. The member states were allowed to print the new currency for their own realms under close supervision, but the Star League government determined the amount.&#xD; First Lord Nicholas also set up the central Stock Exchange (CSE), which allowed ten regional exchange businesses to trade shares in foreign companies. In addition to aiding the economy, the exchanges were supposed to promote peace between the realms, as having economic interests in neighboring states made war less attractive.&#xD; The Central Stock Exchange was located in the Terran city of London. The other stock exchanges and the Star League mints were set up on border worlds between the member states. They were grouped into commerce cities built by the Star League for the use of economists, brokers, and company executives. The cities' protection came from the SLDF, which usually had a major military base nearby.&#xD; The Exchange on Deshler, was one such city; it's mint produced currency for both the Federated Suns and Draconis Combine. With collapse of the Star League, the border world locations of the commerce cities proved to be their downfall, as they soon became targets. The Exchange survived the First Succession War, only to be destroyed early in the Second War.</Description>

Though the First was ostensibly posted to Detroit in 3063 to safeguard the Detroit Consolidated MechWorks from pirate attacks, de facto control of the world - and by extension the plant - remains in Canopian hands. The Magistracy Highlanders have fought off several pirate raids and control of their world remains rock solid, with little interference from the Taurian Concordat, whose leaders are much more concern with their assaults into Davion space.</Description>

    <Description>[3025] Since the signing of the Concord of Kapteyn, the Free Worlds League has opened up its trade routes with both the Draconis Combine. Initially this trade was primarily restricted to art and luxury items, such as alcohol, jade, gold and bronze jewelry, and ceremonial weaponry. This traffic has since escalated to include industrial goods and heavy equipment of all kinds, including military hardware.&#xD; Devil's Rock is one of the worlds within Marik space that this trade is centered on. The starport cities on this world contain magnificent bazaars, teeming with merchant houses, wholesalers, and speculators who can find a profitable market (legal or otherwise) for virtually any commodity. &#xD; [3057] As part of Operation Guerrero, the Third Free Worlds Guards landed on Devil's Rock expecting to encounter minimal resistance from the planetary garrison. This assumption proved to be false; the Third quickly found itself embroiled in bitter street-to-street fighting in the capital of Forest City. In just four hours, the Guards lost two lances of 'Mechs to Federated Commonwealth missiles; total losses amounted to nineteen 'Mechs before the Marik troops finally crushed the resistance.</Description>

Born from Captain-General Gerald Marik�s war against the Selaj�s that he believed killed his family, this small federation bought its loyalty to the Mariks and hastily installed a pro-Marik government. The Free States soon discovered, however, that freedom on paper was worth little against constant meddling in their politics and economy by their former parent province. Not until Thomas Marik passed the Addendum to the Incorporation in 3037 did the Regulan Free States finally gain the power to chart their own course.&#xD; Since then, local cultures and planetary economies have undergone a vibrant renaissance. No longer strangled by Principality trade embargoes, Free State industry and exports are thriving. The Mongol and Kazhak languages, outlawed in the early days of secessionist rumblings and then rendered virtually irrelevant by Principality dominance of local life, have made a striking comeback to become the primary languages in this tiny province. Norwegian is also widely spoken on Olafsvik, site of a sizeable Norwegian enclave since the earliest days of human settlement.&#xD; Diass is governed by a feudal autocracy.</Description>

    <Description>Settled during the original Exodus of the 22nd century, Dieron was one of the most highly developed worlds, both culturally and industrially, during the Star League. It was an administrative center for the BSLA and capital of the Draconis Combine Military Region. In this function, it was also the headquarters for the Fourteenth Army and a major electronics center for the Regular Army. Though the planet survived the coup by Stefan Amaris intact, it was severely damaged by General Kerensky's campaign to liberate the Hegemony. The Regular Army stripped away the few remaining buildings before leaving the Inner Sphere.&#xD; Since the collapse of the Star League, Dieron has been the capital of the Dieron Military District in the Draconis Combine. Legend has it that Minoru Kurita chose Dieron to be a provincial capital out of arrogance; he liked the idea of boasting of having one of the crowing glories of the Star League so prominent a part of his own realm.&#xD; Dieron is a cramped world because of its many large mountain ranges. What space is available exists in countless small valleys, and earthquakes are a frequent problem. With so little to recommend the planet, it is amazing that over five billion people live here.&#xD; The standard of living on Dieron is surprisingly low for a major industrial world, because Takashi Kurita's policy of restricting travel within the Combine prevents the Dieronese from seeing how much of their productivity is taken from them and how little is imported in return. The cramped cities stuck between towering mountains make the planet a hotbed of resistance to Kurita rule, perhaps, the most discontented Kurita world outside the Rasalhague Military District.&#xD; To squash budding rebellions, the ISF plays on the Dieron people's obsession with the Star League. An ISF agent will spread rumors of a Star League cache, causing thousands to flood into the mountains prospecting for artifacts, thus defusing any tensions that had existed before.</Description>

    <Description>Settled by colonists from Western Europe, in particular France and the Low Countries, the verdant world of Dieudonn� was perceived by many as literally God-given, hence its name (though later histories suggest the planet was named for a 20th-century mathematician). The planet�s inhabitants quickly learned to harness its rich flora and fauna; the former have myriad medicinal applications, while the latter are renowned for their exotic tastes and tenderness. Dieudonn� also boasted mineral wealth aplenty, leading to the establishment of refining complexes and manufacturing sites across the two major land masses, Normandy and Vinci.&#xD; Unfortunately, the planet stood at the crossroads of three interstellar realms � the Free Worlds League, the Lyran Commonwealth and the Terran Hegemony � and so became a much squabbled-over prize. The Amaris Coup shattered the Star League complexes that dotted the world, and in the Succession Wars that followed, possession of Dieudonn� went back and forth between the Lyrans and the Free Worlds. Not firmly in Marik hands until the mid-29th century, its strategic position (not to mention its surviving Star League fortifications) made it a linchpin of military operations, and in 2912 it became the headquarters for military operations in the Free Worlds regions near Terra. The command facility just outside the capital, New Bastogne, is heavily fortified and can withstanding direct attack or a prolonged siege. Rival powers have made little overt, concerted effort to seize Dieudonn� in recent years, instead substituting a war of spies for open hostilities. The genteel villas and marinas of resorts in the St. Therese and St. Germaine archipelagos have become the League�s most unusual battlefield, where members of SAFE�s Counterintelligence Directorate spar with their rivals from the LIC, MIIO and Maskirovka.</Description>

    <Description>[3039] Except for New Ivaarsen or perhaps Le Blanc, the strike on Dobson in September was in the most precarious position of any of the Operation Orochi attacks � the Draconis Combine�s feigned counter-invasion of the Federated Suns during the War of 3039. While many of the worlds targeted had relatively strong military garrisons, none except Dobson and New Ivaarsen were home to any significant �Mech forces. It was well-known that the Second Chisholm�s Raiders served as a �feeder� unit for the First Raiders, but the fact of the matter was that it was also a full BattleMech regiment and would represent a significant threat to any forces assigned to the world.&#xD; In part, that was likely why one of the combined mercenary/Ghost battalions was chosen for the operation. In fact, it was almost as if the strike on Dobson was designed to keep the Second Chisholm�s Raiders from redeploying to counter any additional Combine moves (though no official documents or interviews have ever surfaced to support that inference). &#xD; The �Ghost� strike on Dobson was tragically short for the Combine MechWarriors and their hired guns. They struck in early September, attempting to fight a mobile campaign and to convince the Chisholm�s Raiders that they were a much larger force than they really were. The trouble with that, however, was that the mercenaries hadn�t had the chance to work closely with the Ghost MechWarriors for very long, and as a result the coordination between even lances often broke down. &#xD; Colonel Kilian Reason, recently installed as the Second Raiders� commander, almost immediately recognized his enemies� weakness, but he also had to deal with the fact that he had just taken over as commander in July and was still getting to know his regiment�s capabilities. He had no choice but to face the crucible on the battlefield, however. Reason had come to the Raiders from the Tenth Deneb Light Cavalry, and brought with him concepts of maneuver that his battalion commanders proved all but unable to comprehend. It was for that reason alone that the Ghosts survived on Dobson for as long as they did.&#xD; Colonel Reason literally had to lead from the front and show his MechWarriors their true capabilities. Taking direct command of the heaviest and least maneuverable battalion in his regiment, he literally astounded both his enemies and his own officers with what he could accomplish. He initially struck the Ghosts from through a mountain pass thought impossible to cross, destroying more than a company in the first hour and forcing the Combine battlegroup into retreat. Reason pushed hard for three more days, keeping pace with the Ghosts as they leapfrogged their DropShips in an attempt to rest long enough to load up and retreat from the world. &#xD; The Raiders� leader never gave them that chance, though, and they had to make a final stand at Port Angel, near the world�s southern pole. The two forces fought amid the mountains and deep snow in a battle that was nearly the end of both battalions. The Ghosts ultimately retreated out over an ice flow; though on average several meters thick, there were a number of weak points and cracks. One Combine DropShip literally fell through the ice after landing, taking with it several �Mechs. Several more �Mechs from both sides were similarly lost when some MechWarriors took to targeting the ice instead of their enemies.&#xD; Colonel Reason quickly recalled his battalion�s survivors, rather than let them be swallowed by the icy waters. The Ghosts retreated shortly thereafter.</Description>

This mercenary unit, whose members claim undying devotion to the high moral standards espoused by the Cameron family of the Star League, could not decide whether they should fight the Clans or honor these descendants of the Star League�s Regular Army. For General Felix Dewey, the answer was clear. The Knights� honorable contract with the Federated Commonwealth had to be fulfilled. Thus it was that the First Knights of St. Cameron met and fought valiantly against Clan Wolf�s 352nd Assault Cluster on the Cesswarn Plain, in January 3052. &#xD; Outmaneuvered and outclassed, the Knights retreated across the rolling hills and wide plains that make up the majority of Domain's terrain, toward the Kusson Mountains, only to be outflanked at the Zazz River. The Knights suffered a final defeat at the capital city of Kusson, then mysteriously disappeared. The survivors did not retreat offworld, though they had plenty of opportunity to do so, yet no trace of them was ever found. They may have joined the Clans, a plausible but unconfirmed theory.&#xD; [3065] During the Falcon Incursion, Khan Vladimir Ward�s Wolves attempted to make inroads into the Falcon�s Occupation Zone. Unlike the Coventry Campaign of seven years previously, Khan Marthe Pryde was ready for a Wolf attack into her OZ and had troops in reserve, which she then sent to counterattack the Wolves in their own territory. &#xD; The 1st Falcon Velites and 5th Falcon Regulars landed on Domain during March 3065, forcing the defending Clan Wolf Green Keshik to withdraw, whilst suffering heavy and moderate damage themselves.</Description>

Having seen early reports of the world's abundant resources and strategic location, he knew that Donegal would one day become an important and profitable world. By taking ownership of it, Mardsen ensured the success of his own trading company and spurred the eventual creation of the entire Protectorate of Donegal.&#xD; The planet is a mostly temperate world filled with unusual vegetation and wildlife, some of which are exported to other worlds for their food value. Beneath the surface of Donegal are rich deposits of industrial diamonds, rare earths, and metals, which are heavily exploited.&#xD; Donegal is known as the 'Trader's World', and has spawned dozens of importing and exporting companies. Media City, Wellington, Sidley, Palar, and Novorossisk are the main trading centers, spread out over three continents. Donegal also has two working space settlements in orbit around LaGrange points. They are a shabby pair, however, nicknamed 'the Tin Cans' and tending to attract traders of a seedier sort.&#xD; The fact that Donegal hosts the most active Commonwealth Stock Exchange is a sign of its political and economic importance. Donegal is also the home of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth.&#xD; Donegal is also the one of the main centers of Judaism in the Commonwealth. The Ohav Shalom is a huge, ornate synagogue and teaching campus, situated against the sun-baked mountains of the planet's northern continent.&#xD; The University of Washington on Donegal is House Steiner's computer research center. Heavily funded by Nashan Computers, this university nestles amid the Queen Anne Hills of the Seattle continent and is equipped with probably the best computer science facility in the entire Inner Sphere. Though tuition fees are high, enough scholarships and government grants are awarded to ensure that every class is filled.&#xD; Another famous institution located on Donegal, is the Chewska School of Literature, one of the Commonwealths most prestigious arts colleges.&#xD; Located in Media City, the Donegal Broadcasting Company is the Commonwealth's major news and information outlet. The most viable division of the DBC is the Commonwealth Press, whose reports and cameramen are assigned to most of the major Steiner worlds, where they supply highly opinionated stories  for dissemination by holo, newsprint, radio, and video mass media. The DBC's nightly program, The Evening News, is the most widely watched news program in the realm. The anchor of the show, Kari Andersen, is arguably the most recognizable personality in the Commonwealth. both his critics and fans would probably agree that Andersen could make people believe Lord Kurita is a true humanitarian, and that JumpShips are powered by little hamsters running in exercise wheels.</Description>

    <Description>[3039] After leaving Clovis, Tai-sa Angel Ochoa and her Ryuken-go�s first battalion immediately headed to Doneval II as part of the continuing Operation Orochi attacks � the Draconis Combine�s feigned counter-invasion of the Federated Suns during the War of 3039. A sparsely-populated world with only a healthy agrarian industry to offer, Doneval II�s militia was a completely volunteer organization, though they did field a significant force of fast combat hovercraft and two battalions of AgroMechs converted to mount heavy weapons.&#xD; Tai-sa Ochoa landed on the southern continent of Roche Foinn and took command of an old mining complex. From there, they launched attacks on the largest settlements on the planet, hoping to knock out what few command and control facilities that existed on Doneval II, but the decentralized nature of life on the world made that all but impossible. Likewise, even the combat vehicles, weapons and munitions weren�t stored in centralized armories; the world�s population was so small that the �officers� in the militia were trusted to safeguard the equipment assigned to their units�especially as a number of the vehicles and all of the AgroMechs that were used by the militia were also in full-time use by the world�s farmers.&#xD; It took the Doneval Militia just a day to mobilize, but what they didn�t have was the ability to rapidly respond to any corner of the world. On the other hand, after just two weeks the Ryuken significantly cut back on their raids, instead focusing on turning the mining complex they had taken over into a base capable of supporting a large invasion force. Further, they concentrated on maintaining the illusion that several Combine regiments were gathering on the world.&#xD; It took the militia several weeks to do so, but they finally managed to gather the bulk of their forces on Roche Foinn. Surprisingly, Ochoa and her MechWarriors didn�t detect the militia force until it was less than a hundred kilometers away from their temporary base. The Ryuken struck out from their base to meet the assault, confident they could quickly and easily dispatch the militia. For the most part they did � the AgroMech and hover formations proved unexpectedly difficult to dispatch, but the Ryuken BattleMechs nonetheless laid waste to most of the Doneval Militia � though a few independent companies of hover vehicles skirted the battle and struck at the Ryuken�s base, encountering just two lances of patrolling �Mechs, along with the force of technical and support personnel. Ochoa detached a company of her �Mechs to secure the base, which they did in short order. &#xD; The Doneval Militia retreated that same day, having lost almost three quarters of their vehicles and AgroMechs, and never again sortied forth. Ochoa nevertheless made a few retaliatory strikes to punish the militia for their attack, though with the few actual military or governmental targets already destroyed, she had few remaining viable targets. She did, however, extort enough surplus food to feed a force of up to ten regiments for six months.&#xD; But then the Fifteenth Deneb Light Cavalry arrived in late October. Having been prevented from striking Irurzun and instead recalled to Robinson to defend it against a potential attack, its MechWarriors and soldiers were more than ready for a fight. Once Robinson was declared secure against attack, the Fifteenth received orders to remove the Combine threat to Doneval II, which they intended to do with their very first move. The DLC dropped most of its �Mech regiment right on top of the Ryuken�s makeshift base, grounding the RCT�s armor just outside of the base. &#xD; The Ryuken force was immediately overcome and tried to retreat back to their DropShips, only to run into a DLC screening force. Ochoa�s Ryuken fought hard, but were nearly overcome before stray shots ignited a temporary grain silo close to the landing field. The resulting explosion caused enough of a distraction for most of the Ryuken to escape. Only one captured Ryuken MechWarrior survived, and only because she was unconscious in her �Mech � the rest committed suicide rather than fall into AFFS hands.</Description>

    <Description>In contrast to the bleakness of the desert worlds of the Islamic cultures within the Alliance, Dormandaine is a rich agricultural planet that was first settled in 2990 by the sect known as the Gregorian Creed. The Gregorians currently number just over 10000 inhabitants, many of whom have managed to acquire considerable wealth by building large cattle and other meat-producing herds. The Greorians live in large extended families, which reflects the basic Gregorian belief that multiple marriages are necessary to repopulate the many shattered and war-weary worlds of the Alliance. Most Gregorians are married to several different spouses, with internal family councils playing the role of political legislatures and councils.</Description>

    <Description>In addition to supporting two major weapons manufacturers, Dover is the home of the Dover Institute for Higher Learning. Established in 2910, from the remnants of the Peoples Reconstruction Effort university on Ashio, the school has trained technicians, doctors, engineers and even MechWarriors for the past hundred and fifty years.&#xD; Primary-school proctors may forward the applications of promising students to the Dover Institute at the same time they send them to any other Draconis Combine academy. Applicants must meet basic physical and mental requirements and must demonstrate the ability to build on whatever they learn through scholastic records and a thesis paper. In several cases, proving or disproving the theories in these entrance essays becomes the focus of a student's training over his or her four-year course of study.&#xD; Institute students learn the basics in a series of month-long training programs, each separated by a week of general study and testing to ensure the student is eligible to continue. At the end of the five months basic training, students in the bottom 10% of their class are dropped from the program. Those remaining may then progress on in their chosen field. Though the Dover academy offers excellent technical and scientific courses, the only combat-orientated training available is for MechWarriors.&#xD; The Dover Institute graduates fifty or so MechWarriors each year, with many graduates remaining within the Benjamin Military District. Dover graduates often rise to command positions quickly as their hard-earned knowledge carries them beyond the average MechWarrior.</Description>

    <Description>Despite an impressive ring of ice and dust replacing what might pass for a moon for more ordinary planets, Dromini IV does not look like much from orbit. Indeed, this world seems to be half shrouded in swirling grey clouds at any given time, a sign of the turbulent storm systems that constantly play about its surface. With only modest raw-material and fossil fuel resources to exploit, the local manufacturers and businesses never produced anything on Dromini that could not be found on dozens of other nearby planets, nor has the world held any great strategic significance.&#xD; Nonetheless, this small industrial planet's location on the Combine/Lyran border made it a favored staging ground during the centuries of war following the original Star League's demise. Houses Kurita and Steiner clashed over Dromini in a number of historic campaigns, the most spectacular of which was the Wolf's Dragoons' assault in 3021, which helped break the back of a planned Combine invasion into the Lyran Commonwealth's Skye Province.&#xD; Each round of fighting, and change of allegiance, damaged the local economy and infrastructure, but the victors often repaired what they could before the planet changed hands again. This constant shifting gave the people of Dromini IV something of an identity crisis, with portions of German- and Scottish-speaking Lyran nationals mingling-and often clashing-with Japanese-influenced Combine citizens. Still, even as fighting raged around them, more of these people managed to coexist peacefully than did not.&#xD; This mixture has also provided an excellent venue from which to conduct trade with the neighboring Successor States. Much of this trade is handled through Franchelco, the planetary capital city on the northern continent of Vijave, but major shipping ports and commercial centers exist on all three of Dromini IV's other continents, Kodersia, Epoure, and Apokayik.</Description>

Large automated cultivation and processing plants run continuously, providing five percent of the Confederation's annual food requirements.  A well developed sea-based farming industry complements land-based technology.  &#xD; Drozan also serves as a troop base for a variety of motorized and jump-trained militia, with mechanized equipment reserves in place at all times.  Research facilities in the planet's northern hemisphere support a growing food synthesis industry.  Given its importance to the Confederation, at least one battalion of Warrior House troops is stationed on the planet at all times, rotated on a monthly basis to give covert intelligence operatives the impression of larger troop strength.&#xD; [3032] In early 3032, the ever rebellious Duchy of Andurien, and it's new allies the Magistracy of Canopus, attacked the Capellan Confederation. Still weak from the battering it received during the Forth Succession War, many Capellan worlds including Drozan, were lost for little of no cost to the attacking forces.&#xD; The Confederation itself managed to mount a major counter-offensive in March 3032. Aided by the feared McCarron�s Armored Cavalry, the Liao forces inflicted a major defeats on the Anduriens on two worlds, whilst Warrior House Dai Da chi and Kincade�s Rangers meted out the same to the Canopians on Drozan. The ferocity of the Dai Da Chi was so effective, that some Canopian troops began to flee the battlefield at the first sign of the warriors. &#xD; The mercenary Caesar�s Cohorts put up a spirited defense against Kincade�s Rangers and even deflected one assault from elements of the Warrior House, however Major Orosco ultimately withdrew the Cohorts, knowing the Capellan force was more powerful than his employer realized. The Anduriens were not so easily bullied, but with their allies in rout, they could not withstand the pressure from the seasoned Armored Calvary. By 3035, the Capellans had won back all their worlds.</Description>

    <Description>Dubhe's home system, once known as Alpha Ursae Majoris, is another rare binary system blessed by an inhabitable world. Dubhe itself revolves around the outer star, a pale yellow main sequence sun that, at a distance of twenty-three astronomical unit, orbits a cooler orange giant once every forty-four Terran years. The close relationship between these stars has affected the orbit of Dubhe, elongating it as the world passes between them. The effect during these periods produces warmer-than-average summers for a world that is overall quite cool. &#xD; Indeed, every two decades Dubhe's polar caps begin a period of rapid melting that routinely floods the interior latitudes, a process the initial colonists took several generations adapting to. Though the winters on Dubhe are brutally harsh, the melting during this period is enough to gradually raise ocean levels worldwide by as much as one or two meters. Drawn here for the planet's abundance of minerals and arable land, the first colonists placed many of their settlements on the coastal regions of Holidius, the planet's single, equatorial landmass, only to lose them to the flooding damage during these so-called "super-summer" seasons.&#xD; Since then, most of Dubhe's large population centers have been moved to higher elevations well inland, but, while safe for the time being, experts have noticed the increasing intensity of the "super-summer" seasons and the melting of the polar caps. They attribute this more to the effects of centuries of mining and industrialization than to the planet's subtly growing distance from its primary in favor of the secondary. &#xD; During the Star League era, Dubhe was a border world with the Free Worlds League, jointly administered by the Terran Hegemony and House Marik, and was easily absorbed after the collapse of the Star League before the Lyran Commonwealth could stake a claim. As a border world throughout the Succession Wars, however, Dubhe suffered from heavy raiding and the occasional planetary &#xD;invasion, which demolished much of its local industry. &#xD; The planetary capital of Dubhe, is Greenwich.</Description>

It is exactly as its advertisements promise, and then some.&#xD; A small planet, Dustball bakes under its huge and hot sun. The early colonists put up with the brutal heat and lack of water because surveys indicated the presence of rich deposits of gemstones in the ground.  When the reports proved false, most of the miners packed up and left.&#xD; The Malthus family did not.  Moderately rich, intelligent, and not above criminal activity, its members decided to build a complex of exotic casinos, nightclubs, and hotels near the main spaceport.  When the idea proved successful, the Malthus family expanded their facilities to service more and more tourists who came to sample Dustball's pleasures.  Currently, there are five domed cities on the planet, each with its own theme of pleasures.  Much of the money earned here is only semi-legal.  The Malthus family does not worry about that because they are blackmailing so many of the government officials, military officers, and other public figures who once foolishly satisfied their most wicked desires on Dustball.&#xD; [3025] The city of New Monaco is home to the headquarters of Malthus Gambling Unlimited, the legal front for the largest organized crime family in the Lyran Commonwealth. Using the firm as a means to gain entry onto planets, the Malthus family, then starts the gradual build-up of various criminal schemes, all aimed at gaining money and power. This infestation was especially effective on three planets around the family's homeworld of Dustball. The Lyran government threw the company's stock off the Exchange in 3021 when it was finally able to prove that Malthus had not paid taxes to the Commonwealth for 20 years. Steiner agents of the Organized Crime Unit have been unable to infiltrate the family business structure, which is an airtight organization.&#xD; [3054] Due to the Clan War, the once infamous night clubs of Dustball are a thing of the past. When the Clans occupied a world only a jump away, civilian patronage of the Dustball resorts dwindled away to nothing. Recognizing her chance to damage the criminal Malthus family by closing down their businesses here, Archon Melissa Steiner-Davion decreed that no armed-services personnel were allowed to spend their leave on Dustball. Because Kooken's Pleasure Pit is so near, the troops of the Commonwealth are not to upset by this rule. Now the huge, empty casinos host only 'Mech battles.</Description>

    <Description>A warm, dry world chronically plagued by violent, long-lasting dust storms, Dyev was settled initially by Russian and Slavic entrepreneurs hoping to take advantage of the abundant raw metals found throughout the rugged mountains and dried-out canyons crisscrossing its surface. With the planet's water tied up mostly in two small oceans and a handful of meager lakes and rivers, the early colonists had to rely on ice ships for their freshwater needs. &#xD; In the latter half of the twenty-fifth century, however, miners digging deep into the Tupik Chasm for a new vanadium vein instead stumbled upon a remarkable find in the form of a vast underground reservoir of fresh water. Other such subterranean lakes and seas were discovered deep below Dyev's surface over the following decades, mostly near the northern hemispheric canyons, and elaborate irrigation systems were devised to bring this water to the people for farming and general use.&#xD; During the Amaris Crisis, the Usurper's troops attempted to poison these reserves to bring the people of Dyev to heel, and succeeded in irrevocably tainting a third of the underground seas before Kerensky's forces rolled over them during the liberation. When the Draconis Combine claimed Dyev after the League's fall, the Kuritan leadership directed more energies toward restoring the planet's many damaged mining operations than addressing the water shortage, and thus Dyev has relied more and more on ice imports over the centuries that followed. &#xD; Despite this handicap, however, this world has prospered through the years of war, exporting valuable metal ores such as vanadium, chromium, and even a limited quantity of germanium - all valuable to the production of heavy industrial and military equipment. The capital city of Dyev, Novaya Mensk, is located in the northern hemisphere, on the eastern shore of the Morye Syevir ocean, and serves as the commercial and administrative heart of the planet.&#xD; Meanwhile, Trogport, a sprawling spaceport city just south of the larger Aleutican Ocean in the southern hemisphere, is the planet's primary connection to interstellar commerce. Trogport also serves as the home for a majority of the local aerospace defense forces, and as home to the headquarters offices of several local mining concerns.</Description>

But there were also individuals who weren�t so careful, surveyors that didn�t follow standard landing and exploration protocols, or colonists that landed on a world they knew nothing about. When the planet�s ecosystem attacked, they fled, but they didn�t guard their ships well enough, allowing some of the hostiles � be they flora, fauna, or just disease � to enter the ships with them. That inattention led directly to the spreading of dangers that threatened to wipe out entire worlds.&#xD;&#xD; The trachazoi spread to dozens of worlds in the Federated Suns� Outback and the nearby Periphery in just this way.

The discovery of the Helm memory core enabled then-CEO Duke Martin Edasich to reverse this trend and make good on his plans to establish at least one of his factories farther away from the front. &#xD; Further spurred by rumors that DefHes would soon expand its Tharkan engine plants to offset the loss of Edasich productivity, the duke spared no expense in the massive undertaking for a new facility on Aur, dismantling the aging Tentra plant in the process. The Aur factory, one of the first to come on line offering extralight fusion plants for BattleMechs, reassured DefHes executives and ensured Edasich Motors' continued vitality in the post-Succession Wars era.</Description>

Interconnectedness has always had labor problems, and so it will be interesting to see how they handle these employees if they should acquire the company.&#xD; [3067] Konradd College on Edwards is the largest private university affiliated with a religious body�in this case the New Avalon Catholic Church�in the Federated Suns. It began as a seminary attached to a monastery in the early 2500s and slowly expanded its operations, first to include training educators of all sorts by the beginning of the next century and then adding general liberal arts degree programs by the end of that century. The college remained fairly stable throughout the Star League era and the first two Succession Wars, but at the height of the Third Succession War school leaders decided that they had a duty to prevent further loss of knowledge, and they devoted themselves to preserving what information they could. Within cavernous bunkers constructed deep in the bedrock below the college grounds, they secretly built a tremendous library containing everything from computer data tapes, books, personal letters and papers, plans and mechanical drawings, audio and tri-vid recordings, working models, and even paintings, sculptures, and other pieces of art. At the same time, the college assembled the single largest collection of religious artifacts and relics to exist alongside its massive collection of historical weapons and armor.&#xD; Safeguarding this incredibly priceless treasure for almost two hundred years, the college allowed few people to know of its existence, lest someone attempt to take it from them or destroy it. But by the end of the Fourth Succession War it was clear to school leaders that they could begin to slowly release some of its accumulated knowledge, and so they expanded the school�s degree programs. Today, the college offers degrees in a variety of liberal arts and science and engineering fields, though it continues to concentrate on training clergy, teachers, and others in similar service professions. The library and archives remain off-limits to all but a select core of faculty and researchers, though the school has apparently digitally archived everything, making a significant portion available on the NAIS Information Network � certainly the cost for perpetual access to the NIN.</Description>

The Bears 155th Striker Cluster landed just north of the Forth Arkab's main encampment and immediately launched a series of stinging raids. Using the flexibility of the OmniMech to its fullest potential, they thwarted all enemy attempts to determine the number and composition of the Clan forces. Because the Forth had not responded to the batchall, its warriors could only assume that they were vastly outnumbered. Tai-sa Sajulam Kosiridam and his officers opted for a suicide charge into the center of the enemy lines; much to their surprise, the 155th broke and retreated under the weight of the assault.&#xD; The Ghost Bears turned and made for the Carstairs Plains, where Star Colonel Romano Tseng engaged in one-on-one combat against two members of the Forth while her cluster kept the rest of the defending unit busy. In the second one-on-one battle, the Forth�s commander destroyed Tseng�s �Mech. The death of their Star Colonel demoralized the embattled 115th Strikers; leaderless and perilously low on ammunition, they ran before the Forth�s furious assault all the way back to their DropShips at Rockclift.&#xD; There, they reconfigured their �Mechs with laser weapons and awaited their pursuers. The Forth caught up with the 155th and surrounded them, expecting victory, but the Legion�s second battalion collapsed under a heavy Bear counterattack.

Following his father's vision, Nicholas announced in 2621 his intention to finish uniting the member states' economies by creating the Star League Dollar. This became the standard currency everywhere. The member states were allowed to print the new currency for their own realms under close supervision, but the Star League government determined the amount.&#xD; First Lord Nicholas also set up the central Stock Exchange (CSE), which allowed ten regional exchange businesses to trade shares in foreign companies. In addition to aiding the economy, the exchanges were supposed to promote peace between the realms, as having economic interests in neighboring states made war less attractive.&#xD; The Central Stock Exchange was located in the Terran city of London. The other stock exchanges and the Star League mints were set up on border worlds between the member states. They were grouped into commerce cities built by the Star League for the use of economists, brokers, and company executives. The cities' protection came from the SLDF, which usually had a major military base nearby.&#xD; Broker's Haven on El Giza, was one such city; it's mint produced currency for both the Free Worlds League and Capellan Confederation. With collapse of the Star League, the border world locations of the commerce cities proved their downfall, as they soon became targets. Broker's Haven was destroyed early in the First Succession War.</Description>

    <Description>[2403] In 2403, Lord Brian Cameron went to Elbar, a world that the Hegemony had recently acquired through a joint-ownership arrangement with the Federated Suns. The planet was once an arid and inhospitable wasteland that the Federated Suns could do little to transform. When the Hegemony provided assistance in the form of a water purification plant the Elbarians were able to build a small city surrounded by farms and ranches. Lord Brian had spent some of the best years of his life on a relative's farm on Elbar, and during his visit, he rekindled fond memories by touring the new farms and ranches.&#xD; During his visit to one small ranch, he was severely gored by an enraged bull. One of the Director-General's guards shot the bull, but it was too late. Though obviously in pain, Lord Brian called the ranch owner over to him. When Lord Brian asked if the bull has been important, the rancher admitted that it was his only bull and that his fortunes depended on the animal. Lord Brian told his staff to pay the rancher for the bull - when asked why, the Director said that an animal cannot be blamed for its nature, nor should a rancher be punished for a bull with a remarkable aim. He wanted to be both himself and the bull to be remembered. Brain Cameron, fifth Director-General of the Terran Hegemony, died before he could be moved to a place of care.&#xD; The ranch owner took Lord Brian's remark to heart. He had the bull's head mounted and the horns, still smeared with the blood of Lord Brian, coated with plastic resin. By way of apology, he sent the mounted head to the Camerons on Terra. The family accepted the gesture and had the bull's head placed high on a wall in the main ballroom of Cameron Castle, just outside Glasgow, Scotland.</Description>

    <Description>[2580] During the Reunification War, after months of a fairly cautious campaign, General Wexworth advanced into the Pleiades Cluster with the Star League's 4th Corps under his personal command. As expected, the Taurian defense was fierce, and the two sides fought a three-day naval duel that destroyed 13 Taurian and 15 League ships.&#xD; Having disposed of the Taurian navy guarding the Pleiades, albeit at heavy cost, the 4th Corps began simultaneous landings against the industrial worlds of the cluster during May 2580. In every case, the scenario was the same. After an uncontested landing, the troops would barely have time to form up before wave after wave of Concordat Regulars, seeming to have come from nowhere, began to assault the League BattleMechs with any means at their disposal.&#xD; After repulsing the initial counterattacks, the Forth found things tougher going as it entered the Taurian urban centers. On Electra, Taurian defenders used makeshift barricades to trap BattleMechs. Although ultimately victorious, dozens of the Star League's 4th Corps BattleMechs were destroyed or captured in bitter contests.&#xD; When the Cluster was finally pacified in September 2580, the 4th Corps effective strength had been reduced by 40%.&#xD; [3066] Expecting a Davion invasion of the Taurian Concordat which never came, the now paranoid Protector Shraplen ordered his own strikes deep into the Federated Suns. At first his regiments made remarkable progress, having attacked a region of space where the AFFS had few resources remaining - most being tied up in the ongoing civil war. These successes prompted further strikes with the Taurian regiments now believing they could reclaim their ancient homeworlds, and pay the Federated Suns back for their losses in the Reunification Wars. &#xD; By early 3067 however, and with the civil war coming to an end, Duke George Hasek was able to send a massive force of AFFS regulars and mercenary units to cut the Taurians off and repel them. By March of 3067 the Federated Suns had retaken and pacified every world except the Cluster worlds, leaving the Concordat with slippery footholds on these remaining planets.&#xD; Protector Shraplen is determined to keep a foothold within the Cluster, and believes resistance has to last until the upcoming Star League conference. There, Taurian grievances can finally be addressed and, with House Liao's backing, the Protector will push for nothing less than the proper return of the Pleiades Cluster to Taurian rule.</Description>

    <Description>Located at the edge of the Periphery, Eleusis is popular for its lakes. In 2360, the Sultan of Eleusis directed a public works project to lay out a series of small lakes, ponds, and lagoons so that a filigree of water extended for hundreds of miles in all directions. From overhead, the lakes resemble a decoration from the Sultan's favorite copy of the Koran.&#xD; Surprisingly, Islam is not the predominant religion on Eleusis. In the last two centuries, there has been a revival of both animism and worship of Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom. (Theologians of this religion point out that the people worship the aspect of wisdom and personify that aspect by giving it the name "Athena".) The planet's religious diversity has led to problems, the worst being the age-old debacle between the Shi'ite and Sunni Moslems as to whether secular or religious authorities should control the government. The fact that Moslems comprise only 35 percent of Eleusis's population renders the question moot.&#xD; The atmosphere of Eleusis contains traces of poisonous gases that can be breathed safely for only a few hours a day. Consequently, all buildings are air-conditioned, and inhabitants wear filtration devices when traveling outside.&#xD; [3067] The Sixth Oriente have recently been assigned to Eleusis. They are the newest of the Hussar regiments, being not ten years old, and have yet to see real war. Instead, the Sixth has been hunting pirates and smugglers along the Canopian border. Nicknamed the Aardvarks for their ability to hunt down and uncover such troublesome pests, the aerospace-heavy unit has exceeded the LCCC's exceptions and earned numerous commendations.&#xD; Pirate attacks have increased markedly of late, and rumor has it these attacks may not be all they seem. Despite its suspicions, the Free Worlds League has yet to pin blame on any of the nearby realms.&#xD; [3067] The Sixth Oriente have recently been assigned to Eleusis.

    <Description>Originally founded as the planet Chisholm, Elgin was renamed in honor of the heroic actions of Captain Edward T. Elgin, who defended the planet against Marik attackers in 2878. Originally a commercial trading center for Terra and the various independent worlds of the Capellan Zone, Elgin was absorbed into the Tikonov Grand Union prior to the formation of the Capellan Confederation. The large islands that comprise the main landmasses of the planet Elgin support a wide variety of lifestyles, ranging from manufacturing to farming to service industries. The destruction of the Succession Wars dramatically reduced the world's manufacturing capabilities, but a substantial investment by the Capellan government for water purification facilities revitalized the agricultural sector prior to the Forth Succession War. Individual noble families control what industries remain, along with feudal landholdings, some of which date back to pre-Confederation times. Elgin is homeworld for Marion's Highlanders and McCormack's Fusiliers, two veteran units of the Northwind Highlanders. &#xD; When the Federated Commonwealth took over the administration of Elgin, it wisely chose to limit its interference in the daily lives of the noble families who owned most of the planet's wealth. The government's primary contribution to keeping the populace happy was to station only a single battalion of AFFC troops on Elgin and allowing the most prominent families to contribute their own troops to complete the regiment of the Fifth Republican for the planet's protection.&#xD; It fell to the Fifth to counter the terrorist activities led by Liao agents on Elgin, but the unit's efforts to protect the holdings of the nobles were largely unsuccessful. The family heads could find no explanation for their elite troops performing so poorly, until Baron Men Hou of the island of New Ceram captured a Liaoist rebel and learned that the AFFC commander of the Fifth was a Maskirovka spy. What had appeared to be incompetent command was, in fact, deliberate collusion by Leftenant General Abder-Rahman Barton with the Capellan government.&#xD; When Baron Hou exposed Barton as a spy to the other nobles, they immediately ordered their troops to obliterate the AFFC companies. As soon as the FedCom troops were neutralized, the companies loyal to each baron turned on the others. The brutal free-for-all that ensued on the island of Jolo ended within an hour, as all seven barons chose to withdraw and save their strength to fight another day.&#xD; Only a handful of soldiers loyal to the Federated Commonwealth remain on Elgin. They devote considerable, successful effort to misdirecting the nobles' troops so that they fight against each other. They have also surrounded the light industries on Jolo with elaborate traps and mazes to keep infiltrators away from the vast warehouses of personnel weapons stored there. They must also contend with increasingly frequent attacks by pirates bands that raid the island's many small communities for supplies. These soldiers can take comfort in the fact that the pirates have also begun targeting the holdings of the nobles on their raids.&#xD; The capital of Elgin is Sochalladan.</Description>

    <Description>Elidere IV was a gift from Hanse Davion to his brother-in-law, Michael Hasek-Davion, in 3022. The previous Dukes of Elidere were members of the Miklos family and had died to a man in a tragic DropShip accident a year before. This had left the planet, which sits on the border with the Draconis Combine, in a state of uncertainty.  The public reason Prince Davion gave for bestowing Elidere IV on Duke Michael Hasek-Davion was to "keep this vital world in the hand of a strong and trusted aIly.  There is considerable private speculation that Davion gave Duke Michael the planet in an effort to dilute his growing military strength. There may be some truth to this view, for we have learned that House Davion has asked that Elidere IV be defended by some of Duke Hasek-Davion's elite troops. Whether the Duke will allow a regiment of his Syrtis Fusiliers to go clear across the realm is uncertain.  Geographically, Elidere is a rather small and drabworld, with little to make it the focus of so much political maneuvering. Several modest deposits of oil and metals are responsible for the planet's meager metals industry. The largest manufacturer on the planet produces agricultural vehicles for Elidere's farming industry. The capital city of Elidere IV is Jasos City.</Description>

An expedition sent to investigate the tunnel and caverns ultimately uncovered nothing but a series of abandoned mines.

    <Description>Travelers visiting Eltanin are cautioned to take the recommended series of antibiotics and inoculations before visiting the surface, due to a persistent virus that wiped out all native animal life and has ravaged off-worlders since the first colonists set foot on this arid world almost a thousand years ago. The airborne virus, known locally as Eltanin Brain Fever, attacks the central nervous system and has symptoms ranging from a loss of fine motor control to seizures and blindness, eventually leading to death. Scientists tracked the source of the virus to the local wildlife, which was dying off even as the first settlers came to this world. &#xD; Preventative treatments suitable for humans and most terrestrial animals were eventually found, but only after all remaining indigenous fauna had perished. The virus, however, may be the least of this minor industrial world's worries, as local scientists have determined that Eltanin's sun has begun to show all the signs of a star nearing the end of its stable life cycle. Spectrographic analysis and the observation of increased solar flare activity-activity that has already been blamed for Eltanin's increasingly unpredictable climate changes over the past several centuries-have indicated that, in perhaps as little as 8,000 years, the star may nova.&#xD; Though this is no cause for alarm at the moment, the inhabitants of Eltanin have made it a point to maintain an excellent planetwide disaster response system that is also tied into its extensive global network of spaceports. Planetary emergency and relief crews are trained in scenarios ranging from flash woodland fires and meteor strikes to a worldwide evacuation order. Long before such measures should prove necessary, however, the people and industrial concerns on Eltanin remain determined to make the best of this world's easily reached mineral, petrochemical, and agricultural wealth.&#xD; The capital city of Eltanin, Dry Springs, is the administrative and trading center of the planet, as well as one of thirty transportation hubs on the northern polar Platonesia supercontinent where it is situated. Eltanin's second largest city, Burmah, located on the southern supercontinent of Anterratica, is home to the headquarters of Eltanin Interplanetary, a local transport consortium that controls a majority of the planet's fifty-nine spaceports (the extreme number to be used in the event of a planetary evacuation, though most of them are mothballed, but ready to use within hours), and employs a fleet of small and medium-sized DropShips and shuttlecraft. EI also provides day-to-day transport services for Eltanin's many large islands in the tropical and equatorial regions between the two giant landmasses, complementing the planet's seagoing traffic.</Description>

Despite this, Engadine has become a favorite vacation spot for many of the wealthy in the Federated Commonwealth, who come every year to participate in The Rooting.&#xD; Every winter, the ruler of Engadine, Lord President Alistar Daniel, hosts an event known as The Rooting, the only effective method of controlling the population of a local predator known as nolans. These humanoid creatures are particularly nasty beasts, almost 3 meters tall, heavy and fierce. Covered with a thick hide, the nolan uses its two sets of arms to attack. It's three-fingered hands end in razor-sharp claws that easily cut through most material. The nolan's bite is also poisonous, and will kill its victim within a few minutes if not treated. Adding to its natural defenses, the nolan's chameleon-like abilities allow it to blend almost completely into its surrounds. To make matters worse, the nolans also possess enough intelligence to set ambushes and traps for unwary travelers.&#xD; [3056] Most able citizens on Engadine participate in The Rooting, as do many nobles from other worlds who consider this vital exercise excellent blood sport. The Clan invasion called many able-bodied men and women from Egadine, leaving fewer people to carry out The Rooting. By 3056, the nolan population had reached dangerous levels. Packs of the creatures fearlessly attack small villages, killing at random and then escaping. The population increase is also damaging the Engadine Ecosystem, forcing the lord president to hire troops to help him and his staff in The Rooting.</Description>

    <Description>Epsilon Eridani's prime location in the Sarna March made it a valuable crossroads for much of the merchant traffic that flowed through the Terran Corridor. The commercial boom that followed the Forth Succession War made Epsilon E a business and cultural mecca, which in turn made it a prime target for re-conquest by the Capellan Confederation. At the time of the invasion, this planet's garrison consisted of the Epsilon Eridani SMM, a green unit with unclear loyalties. Though nominally loyal to the Federated Commonwealth, the unit's commander, Leftenant General Pierre Benton, owed his first allegiance to his homeworld.&#xD; Chancellor Sun-Tzu Liao's earlier efforts to set up Liaoist cells on Epsilon E largely fell flat, and so he had limited resources to call on once the invasion of the Sarna March began. The few Liaoist rebels, however, caused damage far out of proportion to their numbers. A series of well-planned bombings killed hundreds of civilians and created a serious crisis for the planetary government. A Epsilon's leaders dithered, Leftenant General Benton grew increasingly frustrated with their inaction. Unable to sit and watch his world crumble around him, Benton took matters into his own hands with brutal efficiency. Within three weeks, no Liaoist presence to speak of remained alive on the planet. Instead of praising Benton, Council President Gloria Freeman saw the Leftenant General's actions as a flagrant disregard for the government and ordered him to surrender his unit to government commanders. Benton refused. Calling the Council "a gang of frightened bureaucrats unfit to govern a compost heap," he ordered his &#xD;militia forces against the capital city of Madison. Cheered on by the local people Benton and his militia seized the capital without bloodshed and arrested the council leaders. Benton then publicly addressed Epsilon E's citizens, telling them he had temporarily suspended the Council and taken charge of the planet until new elections could be held. He further declared Epsilon Eridani independent of any Successor State for as long as he remained in control, "because our rulers from the Great Houses have not done well by us. Therefore, I believe we must do right by ourselves." Benton renamed the militia the Eridani Guards, and handily won a popular election two months after independence.&#xD; Under Benton's leadership, Epsilon Eridani continues to be a haven for interstellar commerce in the troubled Chaos March, where groups from various worlds can trade and cut deals. The city of Dori on Epsilon E's northern continent has become the planet's largest trading center. Heavy industry also continues to thrive; the new Kressly WarWorks factory on the southern continent, long a minor producer of military vehicles, has just begun production of its first BattleMech model, the Lineholder. Despite its mediocre performance profile, the 'Mech is inexpensive enough to sell extremely well to all the interested parties currently struggling for dominance in the March.&#xD; Epsilon Eridani has a pleasant, if damp, climate. Few of the world's frequent rainstorms ever become true thunderstorms. The southern continent contains large regions of swamplands, while the northern continent is drier and rockier, as well as containing large areas of hinterlands. The northern continent is also host to infrequent, but spectacular, thunder tempests.</Description>

The eventual assault that broke the hold of Amaris� troops, however, led the Usurper�s men to resort to scorched-earth tactics, razing cities and factories with what remained in their nuclear arsenal. &#xD; After the League�s collapse, the Capellan Confederation claimed the world but devoted few resources to restoring it. The Federated Commonwealth, who captured the world during the Forth Succession War, designed and funded a few programs to rebuild in the areas not blanketed by radiation. Surveys of the planet�s crust showed rich in mineral deposits, and small mining companies set up shop. Between 3034 and 3049, the planet�s tiny population doubled as the mining made its people fiercely proud of themselves and their world. Epsilon Indi�s increasing viability, however, also made it attractive to Sun-Tzu Liao, who installed Zhanzheng de guang networks on the planet in hopes of destabilizing its government.&#xD; The Zhanzheng de guang rose up against the FedCom government during the Sarna March invasion of 3057, and captured several towns. Epsilon�s citizens reacted swiftly and violently, forming vigilante groups and working with the regular militia. One spectacular vigilante attack killed most of the Liaoist leaders, effectively ending the revolution as an organized crusade.&#xD; The Liaoist forces were aided by the Langendorf Lancers, a Marik-backed mercenary unit. The Lancers fought a protracted campaign against the forces of Duke Abraham. Just when Abraham�s forces were about to succumb, the duke called in his own mercenary troops. Deployment of Wolf�s Dragoons and the Tooth of Ymir has restored the status quo.&#xD; Today, even centuries later, Epsilon Indi is a wasteland of deserts, empty seabeds, and bombed-out cities, whose population now inhabits only the polar regions, which were spared most of the fallout. The rich mineral deposits across the planet�s four main landmasses are now accessible to mining operations based in the polar continents of Boreria in the north, and Kantiles in the south.&#xD; Kirst, Epsilon Indi�s largest mining settlement, is located on the northern shore of Kantiles, a scant 400 kilometers from the southern edge of the uninhabitable wastes of the Surterra continent. The north-equatorial landmass of Ithicasia, just east of Surterra, suffered just as badly from the damage of the Amaris occupation and liberation, but is nonetheless home to the domed mining colony of Vogelton.&#xD; The capital of Epsilon Indi is New Rhodes.</Description>

    <Description>[3062] Lord Shraplen's assumption of the Protectorship, after the untimely death of Jeffrey Calderon, has been controversial. An outspoken critic of Jeffrey, he has reversed several standing policies - most notably, those dealing with House Liao - which do not sit well with many senior officers. His obvious fear of House Davion is also reminiscent of Thomas Calderon and reminds everyone of the excesses taken during the military's eight year standing alert. &#xD; There is also the matter of several Calderon heirs, the most likely of which is Jeffrey's illegitimate son Erik Martens-Calderon (born to a senior officer of the mercenary Prey's Divisionals. Though only five years old at the time of Jeffrey's death, Lord Shraplen could have named him regent, instead of usurping the Protectorship for himself.&#xD; One of the louder voices of opposition to Shraplen's rule is Baron Cham Kithrong, Marshal of the Taurian Sixth Corps. The Sixth Corps have presently abandoned their duty assignments and have within drawn to Concordat's spinward-most colonies. Now they are bordering on rebellion, refusing to answer orders to relocate and claiming they will continue to act in the Concordat's best interests.&#xD; [3066] Things came to a head in late 3066, following an ill-fated attempt by Protector Shraplen to bring Baron Cham Kithrong to heel. As a result, brief battles were fought between the Taurian Fifth and Sixth Corps on Marfik and Bell Isle. Baron Kithrong finally pulled back his wayward Sixth Corps and violently cut himself of from the rest of the Concordat.&#xD; Led by Baron Kithrong, the people of six of the Concordat's spinward-most colonies banded together and announced their secession from the Taurian Concordat as a whole until Erik Martens-Calderon is named Protector; Kithrong has publicly sworn that he will see Erik on the Taurian throne or die trying. Formerly recognized on the 19th December 3066, the so-called Calderon Protectorate's capital is based on Erod's Escape.</Description>

    <Description>[3039] For Kanrei Kurita, Exeter was the final stop in Operation Orochi - the Draconis Combine�s feigned counter-invasion of the Federated Suns during the War of 3039. He knew that if Prince Davion didn�t believe his bluff by the time that he reached Exeter, the entire operation would have failed. Moreover, if he penetrated any deeper into the Federated Suns, he would run the risk of the AFFS closing his route of escape behind him.&#xD; Kurita and the Ryuken-go�s second battalion landed at Exeter�s primary spaceport, a man-made island complex constructed during the heyday of the Star League. The Ryuken didn�t land guns-a-blazing, however. Instead, they came in flying a pair of ancient Mules, landing under auspices as freelance cargo haulers. In fact, they spent the first three days on world purchasing supplies and actively attempting to find transport contracts. As they did so, the rest of the unit�s DropShips came in � enough to carry a full regiment of troops.&#xD; The night before those DropShips entered orbit, the Kanrei attacked, taking complete charge of the spaceport, along with most of Chyron, the largest city on the planet. The veritable fleet of DropShips that landed later that day were mostly empty, however, but were enough to simulate the arrival of a full regiment. Kurita continued on the attack, largely neutralizing Exeter�s militia after just a week of operations.&#xD; That gave Kurita the opportunity to almost at-will raid the many warehouses within Chyron, the one major transportation hub on the entire planet. Even after the First NAIS Cadre arrived from Robinson in late September, Kurita continued to operate with a free reign � though the First Cadre by far had the maneuverability advantage, Kurita and the Ryuken were much more aggressive. It took the arrival of the Fourth Davion Guards in early October to finally convince the Kanrei that it was time to withdraw.&#xD; Marshal Eugene Drivers wasn�t satisfied with just allowing the Combine troops to withdraw, however. As soon as the Guards landed, the Ryuken pulled back to Chyron and the island spaceport. Drivers moved into Chyron and prepared to assault the spaceport across the thin linking bridges. Before striking, though, he sent a two-company force of volunteers, under the command of Captain Wendy Adams, underwater to hit the island spaceport from the seaside (all but three MechWarriors made it to land). As soon as Adams� �Mechs emerged from the water, Drivers sent his hovercraft over the water as his �Mechs began to make the five kilometer trek over the connecting bridges.&#xD; The Kanrei made a fighting withdrawal back to his DropShips. He was nearly shot out of his �Mech, but his MechWarriors forced him into the command DropShip and held the line until he was safely away. Two of the Ryuken�s DropShips, along with three that they had commandeered on the ground, never made it off the tarmac. The Kanrei did make his escape, along with most of his battalion and some eighteen thousand tons of supplies taken from Chyron.</Description>

In June 2467, five students from Fatima forced their way into the bedchambers of Archon Alister Steiner, and stabbed him repeatedly with blades fashioned from Fatima obsidian. After a long chase through woods surrounding the capital city, the police captured the assassins alive. Only during interrogation, did they break down and implicate Duke Reynolds of Fatima.&#xD; Alister's oldest son, Michael, was recalled from the front lines and sworn in as the fifth Archon of the Lyran Commonwealth. As Archon, Michael now had the disagreeable task of presiding over the trails of Duke Reynolds, a man he had always loved and respected. Though the Duke vehemently denied any knowledge of the assassination, evidence brought forth at the trial was damning.&#xD; Not satisfied with the courts verdict, Michael sent what amounted to an invasion force of Lyran Intelligence agents to Fatima to investigate the lives of the Duke and the assassins. In the meantime, he held of sentencing Duke Reynolds, though everyone knew that death was the only sentence possible for killing an Archon.&#xD; Late in the summer, members of the LIC returned with irrefutable proof of the Duke's innocence. They had learned that Graf DeSimon, a nobleman under Duke Reynolds, had managed to brainwash some idealistic but impressionable students. Having convinced them that the Steiner family had tricked duke Reynolds out of his claim to the Archonship, he then provided them with false identification so that they could slip into the royal palace and murder the Archon.&#xD; Confronted with the evidence, the young assassins broke down and confessed. DeSimon's motivation became clear when Duke Reynolds told the Archon that he had recently stripped the man of his lands as punishment for treating his landworkers too harshly. When captured and confronted with the evidence, Graf DeSimon confessed during a live broadcast millions listened to word for word. Duke Reynolds was released, and he graciously pardoned his former accusers. Graf DeSimon and his gullible accomplices were executed.</Description>

The Draconis Combine leaders were convinced that Davion knew about the secret factory. However, the Clovis DMM sought a more personal revenge. When they finally broke through the Kuritan defenses, the Davion MechWarriors rushed up the mountain towards the statue, ignoring the Kuritan's attempts to evacuate the factory grounds.&#xD; When the Davion regiment got around to overrunning the factory, Dropships had already lifted off with most of the usable equipment. The statue was sent in pieces back to Kentares. Jinjiro's desecrated head now rests in Martyr Square amid the rusting, decayed shells of the old capital buildings.</Description>

Its staff includes no Nobel Laureates or Safka Fellows. Its only mission is to train the extraordinarily undereducated population of the Federated Suns' peripheral worlds. Because of this, a degree from Filtvet is often considered second-rate by those who attend more prestigious institutes; to most of its graduates, however, it is a ticket to a new and better life.&#xD; The atmosphere within the Academy is one of ravenous competition. Many civilians and would-be cadets see the Academy as their only hope of escaping their otherwise dead-end lives and will do anything to gain admittance to the school. Many students cannot handle its academic demands and are forced to drop out, perpetuating the Academy's high turnover rate. Those cadets that do excel academically are often given the opportunity to transfer to a different academy that will continue to challenge and motivate them.&#xD; Graduation from Filtvet most commonly leads to a position within the Crucis March Militia, though the regiments of the Federated Commonwealth Corps have been known to snatch some of the Academy's outstanding graduates.&#xD; Major General Cluey Monserrat serves as the Academy's commandant.</Description>

Though many Lyran vessels, buildings and even military equipment take their names from it, the Teutonic faith � a polytheistic religion that idolizes warriors and promises those who die in glorious battle an afterlife spent holding back the minions of evil and staving off Ragnarok (the Day of Doom) � has long remained in the shadows, its gloomy forecast for humankind�s future and its warrior bent rarely in keeping with the more peaceful, optimistic elements of the Lyrans� mercantile society.&#xD; In the years immediately following the secession of the Lyran Alliance from the Federated Commonwealth, however, Archon Katherine Steiner-Davion took great pains to emphasize the cultural differences between the Alliance and its former allies in the Federated Suns. This resurgent nationalism brought with it a revived interest in the Teutonic roots of the Steiner dynasty and their cultural influence throughout the realm. A strange side effect of this has been the almost overnight acceptance of Aesirism, a modernized version of ancient Norse mythology.&#xD; Presently centered on the world of Finsterwalde, home of the Great Hall of the Aesir in the city of Glasheim, the new Aesirian religion has a slightly more positive outlook and idolizes non-military �conquests� (such as financial and marital success) in addition to battlefield glory. As the inevitable Ragnarok remains an intrinsic aspect of this faith, many Aesirians embrace life with a �seize the day� mentality. Politically, they almost universally back whichever leaders are closest in association to what they perceive as the true Steiner family, because they believe the Teutonic roots of the Steiner family descend directly from their pantheon.</Description>

    <Description>[2581] In spring 2581, the third year of the Reunification War, General Wexworth attacked the major Taurian mining world of Flintoft. Once again, the Taurian navy contested control of their territory against superior League numbers. Once again, their naval forces were overcome. The Taurians took out 16 League warships before the battle was over, often through suicide attacks by swarms of �fireships� (short-range craft piloted by volunteers and crammed to the bulkheads with explosive ordinance).&#xD; With the system jump points secure, the 1st Corps�s heavy assault regiments dropped onto the planet�s northern industrial sites, bypassing the Taurian defense positions further south. Hoping to gain a solid foothold before the start of the inevitable Taurian armor attacks, the League regiments got a rude awakening when hundreds of Taurian conventional fighters and bombers pummeled their positions with high-explosive and inferno loads. Though League AeroSpace fighters were called in to deal with this new development, many �Mechs were lost before Flintoft�s air contingent was destroyed.</Description>

A number of teams were also assigned to aid scientific studies in the Enders Cluster, a tightly packed group of stars between Aberystwyth and Viborg.&#xD; Though officially at full strength, much of the equipment used by the militia is dilapidated. With parts in short supply, generally only a third of the unit's vehicles and 'Mechs are operational at any given moment.

    <Description>The first colonists to Fomalhaut saw a world blessed with an unlimited water supply and lush semitropical forestlands. Only a pair of small landmasses - Oanhu in the southern hemisphere, and Lyria in the equatorial zone - and a few dozen islands rise from the Endless Seas, Fomalhaut's planetwide ocean. &#xD; Settlers, most descended from the Hawaiian and Filipino cultures of Terra, readily took to this planet, and established themselves on every landmass that could support life before too long. Exploiting the natural beauty, unique three-moon nightscape, and infinite emerald seas, these settlers made Fomalhaut into a resort world. Larger industries failed to take root on the planet, though an orbital ore-refining station was established to take advantage of the metals found on the volcanic inner moon of Scarlet.&#xD; By the time of the Star League, very little had changed on Fomalhaut, and the planet was a favorite getaway for the Terran Hegemony's idle rich. The lack of heavy industry spared the world much of the damage inflicted by Amaris forces during the final days of the Star League, save for the destruction of the Scarlet refining station and the planetary spaceport of Otaku. Thus, when the Draconis Combine claimed the world after the League's fall, they too benefited from the tranquil beauty of this ocean world, though the centuries of near-constant warfare led to the planet being raided by hostile troops on more than one occasion. &#xD; The capital city of Lollanda, is situated on Oanhu.&#xD; [3025] Drearson City is home to the headquarters of O'Keefre Importers-Exporters. This massive import-export firm was once one of the Star League's largest firms, almost single-handedly controlling the flow of public goods in and out of the League. The company's many freighters were a common sight in all parts of the Inner Sphere and Periphery. When the League collapsed, most of the firm's JumpShips and transports were seized by whatever member-state they happened to be traveling through.&#xD; This left O'Keefre stripped of its ability to make money. The wars, especially the many battles for Fomalhaut, destroyed most of the company's remaining assets, but O'Keefre survived and now has reason to be optimistic. The recent alliance between the Federated Suns and the Lyran Commonwealth puts O'Keefre in an advantageous position to play a key role in the coming wave of trade between the two realms.</Description>

    <Description>Discovered almost by accident, Foochow was not colonized until the late 22nd century, by a sizeable population escaping from China on Terra. The planet was named after the capital of the Fujian province in southeast China. Like its namesake, Foochow became a seafood exporter, supplying many worlds. Foochow is fairly unusual in that does not have large polar ice caps. The planet is like a large greenhouse. &#xD; The one continent, Min-how, is located along the equator and was mostly jungle when the first colonists landed. They spent the first 50 years fighting disease-carrying insects and Dobars, large six-limbed carnivores the size of black bears. The settlers overcame the land and were able to make it productive, even taming some of the Dobars.&#xD; Foochow had very little industry until explorers discovered minerals on Min-how's southwest coast. These minerals were used to produce electronics. The town of Redswan is the planet's leading industrial city. The planet's capital, Vashura, located on eastern Min-how, is the largest seaport and produces the bulk of the planet's exports in fish.&#xD; During the Fourth Succession War, Foochow was captured and remained in Davion hands until 3057, when the planet was captured during the Marik-Liao invasion.</Description>

    <Description>[3025] Both the Commonwealth government and the Free Worlds League require that all traders entering and leaving their realms submit to a vessel search. The LCAF usually carries out searches for House Steiner, a routine duty usually assigned to common soldiers who are not too diligent in their efforts. &#xD; Ford is one the three most popular jump points for traders entering the Free Worlds League, which is quickly turning the planet into an economic boom world.&#xD; [3028] Following the disastrous invasion attempt on Loric the proceeding March, House Marik regrouped its forces and lunched a less ambitious assault on the nearby planet of Ford. The initial landings in May 3028 proved successful, and the Marik invaders pushed the planetary garrison halfway across the planet's largest continent of Queensland, before reinforcements arrived and resistance stiffened.&#xD; The battle lines formed along the Sinclair River Valley. The planet's major river, the Sinclair is a formidable natural obstacle, offering only five major crossing points along its entire length. Control of these points was vital for the continuing success of the Marik drive, and so House Steiner was determined to recapture or destroy them.&#xD; Assembling a heavy counterattack force, the Lyrans struck the Marik positions at 0400 hours on the 12th May 3028. The Marik defenders fought desperately but could not stem the advance of the heavy Lyran 'Mechs. Several companies broke through and advanced on the vital bridges. Intense fighting erupted as both sides committed all their resources to win the battle. Finally, the Lyrans withdrew, after suffering heavy casualties. The Marik forces were in equally bad shape, however. After learning that additional Lyran reinforcements had arrived, the Marik forces regrouped and evacuated the planet.</Description>

    <Description>Originally designated as LC/T-2395 when discovered by Lyran Exploration scouts, the colonization of the planet did not start until late into 2640, primarily due to a lack of funding. After the �Long March� campaign, the planet was renamed in honor of Captain Calvin Loudon for his heroic actions on Nox in 2465, wherein he gave his life to save his entire command. Fort Loudon was in the process of development by the colonists when they discovered rare metals in the Jungle Mountains on the continent of Brunei.&#xD; Fort Loudon�s three continents are situated mostly in the equatorial regions of this very large planet. Tunisonda has the most arable land and is the largest of the three continents. The planet�s capital, Palos, was settled on the continent of Anderssen, where gold and platinum veins were discovered in the foothills of the Dover Mountains. Fort Loudon has been prized in the past for its location on the combine border and still is today as a staging post against the Clans. Fort Loudon was home to the Star League�s 123rd Infantry Division, stationed at the still operational Castle Brian, Fortress Loudon.&#xD; [3053] Clan Jade Falcon launched a raid against Fort Loudon in 3053, striking out against the Blue star Irregulars� Twenty-First Rim Worlds regiment stationed there - apparently, the Clan�s warriors had heard of the Irregulars� SLDF origins and wished to prove themselves against such worthy opponents. The Falcons first captured the regiment�s JumpShips, then proceeded to overwhelm the mercenaries in a prolonged assault. Only two shattered companies remained, hidden in the planet�s mountains, by the time a relief force arrived. The Jade Falcons pulled back to Quarrel convinced of their superiority.</Description>

    <Description>The so-called Outer Reaches Rebellion began in early 2236 when the planet of Freedom declared itself independent from the Terran Alliance authority due to high taxes and social constraints imposed by the high-handed Terran plantary governors and administrative officials. The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back came when Colonial Terran Governor Ardath Rathill imposed one tax scheme too many. He issued the Freedom Marriage Tax Bill, requiring that a mandatory dowry be paid to his office before it would issue appropriate marriage permits. This proved too much for the native Freedomians, who to this day are noted for their hot-natured natures.&#xD; When Terra received the colonists' rambling, semi-coherent declaration of independence, military leaders saw it as a revolt, and Parliament took some semi-coherent action of its own. Armed, troop-carrying naval vessels moved quickly from Terra to the system's jump points and beyond. Upon arriving at the frontier, they carried out their orders.&#xD; System jump points were blockaded, detachments of Alliance soldiers patrolled the streets, and colonists possessing weapons were summarily detained and harassed. Smuggled reports carried at great danger by blockade runners spread from world to world, helping to fan the flames of rebellion. Obviously, the Alliance would not acknowledge a peaceful act of secession. This could only mean war.&#xD; As the conflict on Freedom and nearby worlds quickly escalated from martial law to full-scale guerrilla warfare, the Alliance's military response to the situation grew increasingly unpopular. When word of the fighting slowly spread throughout inhabited space, many still-loyal colonies expressed extreme dissatisfaction. Within a matter of months, what had begun as a mere handful of rebellious colonies had grown to several dozen.&#xD; The Alliance military, which had been having enough trouble coping with the colonists' unorthodox tactics on just a few planets, now suddenly found its resources being stretched throughout known space. The sheer cost of mobilizing and transporting personnel and materiel to the frontier, not to speak of the actual costs of combat, rose to astronomical levels. Reports of colonists being executed (true but exaggerated), rumors of biochemical agents used (completely untrue), and Alliance casualty reports (increasing hourly) led to discontent on Terra.&#xD; After a year of running battles on more than 50 worlds, the minority Liberal Party - and many Terrans normally disinterested in politics - made their feelings known. Describing the war as "unwinnable," this group managed to vigorously block all efforts to obtain additional military funding. Low on supplies, manpower, and vessels, the Terran Alliances forces were slowly being forced to withdraw on most worlds. On the other planets, only a few small garrisons remained.&#xD; The colonists had 'Won," if either side could win such an insidious conflict. Military and civilian casualties numbered in the hundreds of thousands. As for the material cost of the rebellion, it was estimated in the tens of billions of credits. The following stagnation of Terran politics lead to the demise of the Terran Alliance, some 80 years after the beginning of the Outer Reaches Rebellion. In July 2315, Fleet Admiral James McKenna announced the creation of the Terran Hegemony, eventually leading to the birth of the Star League.      &#xD; [3025] Water Pure Industries, the largest of the five Commonwealth companies currently manufacturing water purification systems, has a small plant on Freedom.</Description>

The CCAF was broken, she believed, but it still retained substantially more troops than she could command. As such, a key strand of the Andurien-Canopus invasion plan attempted to keep the Liaos guessing, targeting a variety of worlds and then pulling back. The unit assigned this operation in the opening stages of the war was the mercenary Carson�s Renegades, who had been displaced in the FWLM withdrawal from worlds near Terra and had accepted a two-year contract with the independent Duchy. &#xD; Their second target was Fronde, coreward of the line of advance but a potential target, the raiding of which might draw off CCAF troops. The renegades met no resistance to their landings on Fronde in December 3030, and little after they�d secured their landing zone. As with their prior assault on Altorra, the short, sharp campaign that followed could easily have forced the world�s capitulation, and the world�s government broadcast a request to treat with the invaders, but the mercenary commander followed his orders precisely, making their presence clearly visible while causing minimal damage and loss of life.

Furillo is home to a Defiance Industries BattleMech factory (formerly Tolsand WarWorks, located near the city of Snohomish Springs in the shadow of the Mont Vert on the Dereka continent), as well as Lockheed/CBM's helicopter plant (near the capital city of Telesian on the southern Wilda continent), and a Nashan and Defiance military electronics plant (near the Defiance factory). &#xD; The world is also home to a host of heavy industries that supply other Alliance planets with everything from personal entertainment systems and communicators to hand weapons and IndustrialMechs. It also bears the dubious distinction of homeworld to Alessandro Steiner, the Archon deposed by Katrina Steiner in 3007, who lived in Kelestra City, the largest city in Dereka. &#xD; Furillo is a pleasant world of snow-capped mountains, whose people are much more politically moderate than others in Bolan Province, but who remain loath to consider any form of reconciliation with the Free Worlds League. Nevertheless, the natives universally profess undying loyalty to the Steiner family, and have steadfastly followed every edict handed down from Tharkad since the incorporation of the Lyran state, no matter how distasteful.&#xD; [3062] The Furillo BPM has a close relationship with the military industries of Furillo. They garrison the factories of Defiance Industries, N&amp;D, and Lockheed / CBM, and have built up strong working relationships with the corporations. The emphasis on defending the industrial sites has, however, proved unpopular with the general populace of Furillo, who accuse the BPM of placing profits before people.</Description>

    <Description>As its star, a red giant over a hundred times the size of Sol, is well into its final years, Gacrux, too, is a world in a state of decline, cooling as the warmth of its primary fades more and more with each passing century. Despite its lack of water and nutrient-poor soil, colonists were drawn to Gacrux by its abundance of precious metals, industrial ores, and radioactive materials, establishing several mining and manufacturing operations here. Most of these settlements naturally arose on the shores of the planet's two large, landlocked, freshwater oceans, Praddis and Umberholdt.&#xD; Though lacking in sufficient resources to feed a booming population itself, Gacrux prospered as an industrial world, becoming a member of the Federation of Skye soon after the fall of the Terran Alliance. The nearness of the expanding Free Worlds League, however, exposed Gacrux to many raids over the years, enough so that the people of this world eagerly embraced the union of the Federation into the Lyran Commonwealth. Since that day, the people of Gacrux became known for their remarkable loyalty to the Commonwealth, and were among the few Skye worlds not opposed to Steiner rule during the region's rebellious years. &#xD; As time went on, and Gacrux survived repeated assaults from neighboring realms, however, the Gacruxians' sense of nationalism evolved into a kind of xenophobia. The locals protested the Commonwealth's alliance with the Federated Suns and the militia forces constantly lobbied for military action against the Free Worlds League. This attitude made Gacrux one of the strongholds of a Lyran supremacist movement - formerly a veterans association - called the Brotherhood of Cincinnatus, a group that achieved infamy during the mid-thirty-first century for a string of domestic terrorist attacks. &#xD; The capital city, Fort Habersburg, is located on the southern coast of Praddis.&#xD; [3062] Containing a large number of semi-retired veterans, the Gacrux FTM is a stronghold of the Brotherhood of Cincinnatus. They have long opposed the Federated Commonwealth, whose formation ironically led to the militia's creation. Though the secession of the Lyran Alliance from the Federated Commonwealth pleased the militia, the alliance with the Free Worlds League did not. The FTM has since argued for a resumption of hostilities against the Alliance's rimward neighbor. This aggressive stance has prompted the LAAF to keep the militia on a short leash, restricting their supplies and access to transport assets so as to prevent an "independent operation" against the League. The Free Skye movement has made numerous attempts to draw the militia into its tangled web but all to no avail.</Description>

    <Description>Until the 3030's the principal hiring hall for mercenary troops within the Inner Sphere was the so-called Mercenary's Star of Galatea. When Wolf's Dragoons took over the planet of Outreach in 3030, the governments of the Inner Sphere shifted their mercenary recruiting efforts to that world. This caused Galatea's economy to nearly collapse. The mercenary trade had been the basis of its economy, but the only units who came there now were those too inferior to compete on outreach, or those who would not or could not go through legal channels to be hired. Where Galatea had once been the Mercenary's Star, it is now a virtual den of desperate men and women who don't care whether or not they live within the law.&#xD; Unlike Outreach, those who come here recruiting do not want their presence advertised. Most of their contracts were for jobs well beyond the law of any Inner Sphere government, so as piracy, assassination, subversion or kidnapping. Galatea also runs a series of 'Mech games, from which many of the recruiters pick and chose their warriors. Unlike the duels of Solaris VII, these battles are down and dirty, and usually to the death.&#xD; Galaport is the capital of Galatea, as well as being home to its major starport.&#xD; [3057] Since the formation of the Chaos March and the increased difficulty in travelling to Outreach, Galatea has seen a renaissance in legitimate mercenary dealings, a process encouraged by the LAAF and supported by Mercenary Liaison Corps operations to police the deals.&#xD; [3062] In early 3062, the Mercenary Review and Bonding Commission recognized Galatea's position by establishing a satellite office on the world to help maintain standards.</Description>

    <Description>In some ways, Galax is the exact opposite of nearby New Avalon, in being both water and life-poor. Galax was not much popular as a colony site. The tainted and unsettled atmosphere, constantly churned by the planet's one large moon, kept away all but the staunchest. The perseverance rewarded those who came when huge deposits of almost every valuable mineral, metal, gemstone, jewel, and oil were discovered on Galax. It was not too long before the arrival of a new flood of colonists willing to brave the conditions in search of wealth. If was good that New Avalon, with its abundance of food, was nearby, because the Galax population soon grew far beyond the planet's ability to sustain itself without the help of huge food imports.&#xD; During the peaceful years of the Star League, Galax was the focus of the Climate Restructuring and Adjusting Project (CRAP), a project sponsored by the Star League and funded by a Davion government eager to see the planet exploited. In the years 2721-33, CRAP engineers altered the planet's atmosphere with chemical and heat generators that slowly filtered out the most toxic elements while upping the oxygen content. By the end of 2733, the atmosphere was completely tamed, which sparked another wave of colonists. The project was such a success that firms from throughout the Star League began to open factories on Galax. The biggest of these was Boeing Interstellar, which built the huge Galax Megaplex on the planet during the League's last years.&#xD; Since the fall of the Star League, Galax has been vital to the Federated Suns war effort. Some of its industries, especially those that depended on the Terran member-state for direction, eventually died out because of the decline of technology. Most of the other industries have survived, though the Star League machinery is now jury-rigged and patched together from years of make-do repairs.&#xD; Two things could shut down the many industries of Galax. The first would be disruption in the flow of vital foodstuffs from New Avalon. One estimate indicates that a disruption of a single month would be enough to create panic in a population that has always been politically nervous. The other threat to Galaxian industries is the planet's weather. Over the past decade, a team of meteorologists from the NAIS has proven that the atmosphere of Galax is going toxic again, and at an alarming pace. If it were to become necessary for inhabitants to again wear environmental suits, as was necessary before the CRAP project, there might be a mass exodus offworld. This would, obviously, interrupt the flow of goods from the planet, causing economic and military difficulties throughout the Federated Suns.&#xD; [3025] Canaveral City on Galax, is home the head office of Galax Launch Systems and Satellites, who provide planets in the Federated Suns with a wide variety of satellites and launch systems. The satellites, using a common framework, can easily be customized to handle almost any combination of tasks, such as communications, resource mapping, navigation, or security. The launch systems also vary between chemical or liquid rockets, payload drivers, or orbital mules. All Galax products are built at their factories on Galax, then shipped to the client. Their reputation as reliable manufacturers has sparked interest in House Steiner, which might invite Galax Launch Systems and Satellites to open a sister company in their realm.&#xD; Located on Galax, the Armstrong Flight Academy was built during the First Succession War to train DropShip and JumpShip crews. The reason the AFFS chose Galax was because Federated-Boeing, the Inner Sphere's largest DropShip manufacturer, was also located on and around the planet.&#xD; Today, the teaching staff at the Armstrong Flight Academy are also employees of Federated-Boeing. Their expertise makes graduates of this academy some of the best DropShip and JumpShip crewmen in the AFFS.&#xD; Colonel Jaswa Punalla currently commands the Armstrong Flight Academy.</Description>

    <Description>This lightly settled planet has little industry but abundant high-grade industrial diamonds.  Settled in 2282, Galedon V's vast resources and large quantities of uncontaminated water brought colonists in by the droves.  It was the common hatred against the Ozawa Mercantile Association that led the inhabitants of Galedon V to ally with Shiro Kurita to form the Alliance of Galedon, an amalgamation of worlds under the authority of Shiro.  It seems that Shiro fooled the entire Galedon Colonial Board into believing that Galedon was an equal partner in the Alliance.  Shiro captured more and more worlds, however, and soon dropped the pretense of the alliance.  With firm control of the leaders of the Colonial Board, Shiro turned his attention to other planets.  Nevertheless, the citizens of Galedon V reacted bitterly to Shiro's "usurpation."  In 2332, waves of revolt swept the planet, but even though the armies of Shiro Kurita were occupied with the Principality of Rasalhague, enough forces arrived to slaughter the rebellion and its leaders.  They left behind ruined cities and starving civilians.  Shiro's Colonial Board then helped rebuild the planet, all the while praising Shiro for his benevolence and charity.  The starving civilians soon became grateful to Shiro for providing them with food and shelter, and the planet Galedon V has been a staunch supporter of the Kuritas ever since.</Description>

This did much to win the fledging League acceptance from the Southwesterners� long suffering neighbors. &#xD; [3038] 3038 saw a handful of other actions as the FWLM raided its neighbors and was raided in turn. On Galisteo, almost as far from Andurien - and the campaign being fought to return the rogue province to the fold - as was possible while remaining in the Free Worlds, Swann�s Cavaliers came under attack by the Thumpers, a regiment in Lyran employ. &#xD; After an initial assault that very nearly saw the Lyran troops overrun their HQ � the Cavaliers were scattered across the planet � the mercenaries rallied and the two units fought a war of nerves and maneuvers that lasted several weeks. The animosities engendered in the campaign would fester over the years that followed, resulting in a number of repeat engagements as the two units raided and counter-raided.</Description>

    <Description>Gallery has long been known as one of the darkest and moodiest worlds in the Commonwealth.  The stormy climate, born from three seas and a large moon, cloaks the surface of the planet in an almost perpetually violent night seldom penetrated by light from a small sun.  Why the Steiner family chose to hold onto such a dismal world when they once had control over many more pleasant planets no one knows.  Because the planet had no native lifeforms, the colonists had to import species adaptable to the dark conditions.  Gallery supports a fairly large mining industry that searches beneath the surface for pockets of diamonds and metals.  Considering the dark and gloomy atmosphere above ground, it is not surprising that Gallery natives make excellent miners: the atmosphere in a mineshaft is not much different from the conditions on their homeworld.&#xD; [3067] Founded during the closing years of the Second Succession War, Dynamics Company grew up on Gallery as an equipment manufacturer geared toward supporting several local mining businesses. Producing personal and automated mining devices&#xD;at first, the company branched out during the Third Succession War, adding a missile weapon production facility and test range to gain a foothold in the military marketplace. On numerous occasions, the Cathaways � who have dominated Dynamics� board of directors for more than 200 years � have made noises about expanding into WorkMech or even BattleMech construction, but at present nothing solid has materialized.</Description>

    <Description>[3039] Neither Colonel Archibald McCarron nor his regimental commanders found much comfort in the post-Fourth Succession War era. They welcomed any hope of battle, for they knew that would at least keep the Chancellor and her evil eye from targeting them as she had struck out at so many of her other military leaders. McCarron was surprised when three CCAF senior colonels visited him on Menke in May of 3039, and all but stunned when they suggested he undertake an operation of such magnitude into the Federated Suns. But as he looked over the intelligence reports that they had brought with them, McCarron was quickly won over. &#xD; By no means a full-fledged invasion, it was in fact more than anything designed to be more of a morale-building exercise. The CCAF had just recently driven the Canopians from their nation, but that victory was tempered by the fact that it took five years to do so. The CCAF needed was a true victory, one that was unmistakable and could proclaim to the entire Human Sphere that the Confederation was once again a military power, and who better to target than the mighty Federated Suns.&#xD; Gallitzin was a natural target for the Big Mac�s attacks, as just a few years earlier it had nearly fallen to a pro-Capellan government in a civil conflict that lasted more than a year. Only the intervention of the mercenary Cunningham�s Commandos had prevented the world from falling entirely into the Confederation�s grasp, but even after a little more than two years of hard work, the world�s leaders had yet to eliminate the pro-Capellan insurgent groups that continued to plague them. It was then little surprise when that world ended up as McCarron�s fifth target.&#xD; Colonel Archie McCarron knew well of the rebel groups still on the world, and through his contacts in the Strategios contacted them to inform them that �help was on the way.� The Third MAC�the Wild Ones�landed on 13 August amid a world already beleaguered. The militia had already started to fully mobilize; the problem was that there were numerous insurgents within the militia�s own ranks, including several in leadership positions. That, coupled with terrorist bombings and kidnappings carried out before the Wild Ones even entered the Gallitzin System, touched off another civil war on the world. &#xD; The arrival of the Wild Ones only added fuel to the fire. The mercenaries targeted government buildings, utility services, communications facilities and other key infrastructure, quite effectively dropping a blackout over the entire planet. The mercs took what they wanted from the militia armories and the spaceports and left the mess behind. &#xD; Just as with the previous worlds struck by the Big Mac, the Wild Ones spent a single week on the world, though in the case of Gallitzin the damage they caused reverberated for years to come. It would take the Federated Suns two years to repair all of the damage caused by the rebels and the Third MAC, and the AFFS some eight years to finally drive the last of the rebel groups completely underground (these rebels later resurfaced during the Clan war, again during Operation Guerrero and finally once again during the FedCom Civil War, though never again in the same strength they displayed during the 3030s and �40s).&#xD; Gallitzin is also home to the sometimes deadly virus known as Black Marsh Fever.</Description>

The Wagnall Plain, as it is known, is an immensely large area, well-watered and eminently suitable for cultivation. The other two continents consist mostly of desert or mountains, except for coastal flood plains and tropical jungles along the equator. &#xD; Galtor's capital of New Derry is situated on Eire. The planet's major industries are textiles, food processing, fertilizers, and genetic crop research. Galtor has two moons small moons named Temos and Froma, after two founding fathers of the colony.&#xD; The Age of War had little effect on the Galtorians, who traded their agriculture with anyone who paid in hard currency. The Star League era brought further prosperity, with the military becoming the largest customer for Galtor's harvest. By 2725, Galtor's produced fed a billion soldiers on a thousand worlds.&#xD; The fall of the Star League hit Galtor hard. Trade dried up, refugees flooded the planet, and in 2784, League troops abandoned Galtor to join Kerensky's exodus. Galtor itself was spared the horrors of war for another 16 years, until the forces of the Draconis Combine landed to claim the planet in the name of House Kurita. Life under the Dragon was grim and sullen, with the free enterprise system replaced with a crushing quota system.&#xD; In 2905, the Federated Suns bombed the Kuritan base on Galtor. Although the Davion forces did not invade, their attack sparked the fires of resistance within Galtor's population. Eventually Galtor was freed from the grip of the Dragon in 3022. The toll of Liberation was terrible - cities razed, forests burned, and whole communities wiped away. Over 35% of the population died, and a quarter of the survivors left homeless.&#xD; However, the horror and terror did not end for Galtor III. In 3025, Hanse Davion started the opening gambit of Operation Muffet - a trap to destroy Kurita's best regiments. The bait was to be a fake Star League depot, constructed by Davion's engineers, and designed to be a deadly trap. Then the survey team on Galtor III found a real, untouched Star League depot about three thousand kilometers from the false site. Despite numerous ups and downs throughout the campaign, the forces of the Federated Suns were eventually victorious.</Description>

Tai-sa Albert Brookhaven and his troops holed up in Cordivas Grotto, knowing that the Clan forces would have to pay a high cost to dislodge them. Rather than attacking the Third as Brookhaven had hoped, however, the Smoke Jaguar commander chose to wait out the Regulars.&#xD; Realizing that he faced a choice between fighting or remaining trapped indefinitely by Jaguar troops, Tai-sa Brookhaven scouted out the best possible avenue for retreat to the Third's DropShips and then led his forces out of the Grotto.&#xD; During the running battle from the Grotto to the south end of the Filmore Steppes, where the Third's DropShips waited, a Star of OmniMechs chewed up Brookhaven's command company. Lighter elements of Trinary Command kept the rest of the Third busy until Trinary Assault arrived. The Smoke Jaguar forces of the Seventh Jaguar Dragoons destroyed an entire battalion of the Third Alshain Regulars; most of the remaining two battalions managed to retreat off-planet.&#xD; [3059] Wave Three of Operation Bulldog saw a number of battles in which the Smoke Jaguars offered little resistance before withdrawing and surrendering possession of the planet. In one regard, the battle of Garstedt was one such conflict, with a small Jaguar force acting as rear guard while the remaining forces boarded their DropShips and fled. Yet the battle was atypical of Clan fighting tactics, taking place in the confines of the N�rnburg Canyon. Though classified as second-line troops, the Seventeenth Jaguar Regulars proved that even rear-echelon warriors were a force to be reckoned with.&#xD; Hard pressed by the SLDF troops, Trinary Echo held the N�rnburg Canyon for more than four hours, allowing the remainder of the Seventeenth Regulars and the 143rd Battle Cluster to evacuate the world. Only when a light company of Ryuken-Go circled behind the remaining Clan 'Mechs were the Jaguars dislodged. By the end of the battle, it had become a swirling melee, with Clan and Inner Sphere 'Mechs in hand-to-hand combat. Only two Clan warriors survived the battle, but they had delayed elements of the Sixth Lyran Guards, Ryuken-Go, First MAC, and the Com Guard 79th Division, earning themselves a place in the history books.&#xD; [3067] Having escaped major damage in Operation Bulldog, the 22nd Dieron Regulars were not as lucky during the Combine / Ghost Bear War. Notwithstanding their tactical prowess, the Regulars were hammered by the Third Bear Guards and forced to retreat after just two weeks of fighting. Half the Second Sword of Light attempted to relieve the Regulars, though only arrived after they had withdrawn. The Second managed to tie up the 283rd Battle Cluster, though they themselves took a battering until the arrival of the 10th Ghost Legion.&#xD; The Twenty-second Dieron Regulars returned to their posting on Garstedt only after the wars end, where the remain under extensive repair and refit.</Description>

Devastated by (allegedly inadvertent) bombings during both the Second and Third Succession Wars, the library nevertheless still contains well-nigh Alexandrian collections in several fields, particularly physical sciences and languages.  It was this latter fact that promoted the establishment of the Capellan Institute of Linguistics on Geifer in 2978.  In addition to the Institute's purely scholarly work, which has been hailed throughout the Inner Sphere, the political applications of its studies have proven invaluable.  Not only are Capellan diplomats well trained in the art of understanding the thought processes of other cultures, as reflected by their native languages, but the Capellan secret service easily translated several Kurita dispatches because they were in Japanese rather than in code.</Description>

    <Description>During the latter part of the 22nd century, explorers financially supported by investors from the Italian province of Genova were paid to find a world they could settle. A suitable world was located less then 90 light-years from Terra, and in 2300 seven ships carrying 100,000 colonists set out for their new home. What they found was not what they were expecting. &#xD; The planet they named Genoa (after the port city in the Genova Province) had been forced from its orbit in a brief but violent journey precipitated a millennia ago by a passing meteor. The world's lush plant and plentiful animal life died off, leaving a barren, dry, rocky, and only marginally habitable world. The planet's harsh frozen environment forced the population underground. It was here that they discovered huge underground lakes teaming with aquatic life. They also discovered vast deposits of rich ore, minerals, and high-grade gemstones.&#xD; The planet began thriving, and by 2315 became a member of the Liao Protectorate until it was taken by the Terran Hegemony. Vast networks of tunnels were cut during mining operations. Small underground cities were built throughout the northern and southern continents. The capital city of Columbus and two of the planet's four spaceports are located on the northern continent, Rivera, where the large veins of ore are mined. Most of the high-grade gemstones and minerals are mined on Genova, the southern continent. All raw materials are shipped to ports via a mass underground-transit system. &#xD; After the fall of the Star League, Genoa became a Liao world. That lasted until the Fourth Succession War, when House Davion captured the planet and held it until FedCom collapsed in 3057. Genoa was part of the Chaos March, refusing to bow to Liao raiders during the Xin Sheng movement, though control was regained by the FedSuns in the waning months of the FedCom civil war.</Description>

    <Description>Located in the Draco Constellation, Giausar was neglected by research astronomers and stargazers alike for quite some time. The star system was not even considered for colonization until Terran Alliance scouts discovered, quite by accident, that the third planet could support flourishing life. Though limited to the two continents of Adelaide and Deception, Giausar�s climate and gravity were almost perfect.&#xD; Giausar is a large world whose continents are a study in contrasts. Adelaide is a large continent, covering half of the planet through both hemispheres. It is lush and green, the landscape dotted with flat fertile plains, thick forests and old rolling hills. Deception, on the other hand, is not what it seems. From orbit it appears green, but that is attributed to sunlight reflecting off the green tinted soil. It is actually a desert continent, located in the southern hemisphere.&#xD; Colonized by ethnic Germans from southern regions of Germany, they named their capital New Munich, founding it on Adelaide. Because of its location on the Lyran Alliance/Free Worlds League�s border, Giausar is an important world for trade between both realms. Giausar produces petroleum and natural gas from Deception�s rich resources. From Adelaide, coal, timber and iron-ore are produced. Giausar holds Oktoberfest every year in honor of their past. Giausarians are fiercely loyal to their heritage, history and the Commonwealth.&#xD; This world is one of the few that supports dinosaur life similar to that of Terra�s distant past. These rare creatures live mostly in harmony with the human population, aside from the occasional frightening encounter and even rarer deaths.</Description>

The natives of this arid, culturally diverse world perceive Regulans as their oppressors. Independent for three and a quarter centuries, they are still wary of Regulans, but have lately sided with the Regulans in the Free Worlds Parliament.&#xD; Formed from dozens of ethnic and religious groups, the people of Gibson cling tenaciously to their Terran heritages and customs. In the capital city of Portent, it is not unusual to see men in dashikis walking with women in dirndl dresses: neither is it unheard of for one to hear three of four languages spoken in a quarter-kilometer of one of the many shopping districts. The largest single religious group is Buddhist, but all other major religions (and several minor sects) are represented in large numbers. One neighborhood in the capital is divided equally between Arabic and Japanese people, and a small town nearby has Quechua as its second official language.&#xD; Geographically, Gibson was once 80% land, but the contours of its surface made it ideal for terraforming. With the importation of water, lakes and rivers occurred naturally as the first rains ever fell on many parts of the planet.&#xD; Brigadier's Gibson factory is actually a converted repair facility.

    <Description>A tropical world covered in deep, green oceans, Gladius seemed a virtual paradise to the first colonists to set foot upon its soil. Fertile lands and an abundance of native fauna suitable for human consumption - particularly on its single, large continent of Garamond, located mostly north of the equator - made the establishment of the first settlements easy. &#xD; However, the rugged terrain and thick, fast-growing tropical jungles of the interior lands limited the amount of arable space, and the relative lack of industrial metals and other rare materials limited significant industrial growth. Making matters worse over time was that fact that the Gladiusian soil easily "burned out" when used for farming; its rich nutrients expended easily under constant harvests, a matter largely attributed to the planet's subtle seasonal changes.&#xD; Gladius's largest industry thus changed to tourism and hospitality as the world became known as a vacation spot - the kind of place people visited or retired to, but few actually lived in.&#xD; Through the Succession Wars, Gladius was overlooked by most invading armies due to its lack of tactical or industrial value, and the world became little more than a convenient jump point to other destinations. This lack of military importance, however, became the planet's major selling point in the latter half of the twenty-ninth century, when the peoples of the Inner Sphere gradually began to tire of constant war.&#xD; Numerous "retreat communities" sprang up on the isolated islands and coastal regions on and around Garamond; miniature cities almost completely dedicated to off-world vacationers, with few (if any) local residents. Though visitors were often encouraged to stay, few actually did so. Even today, Gladius remains little more than another tropical getaway for the idle rich.&#xD; The capital city, Hyacles, is located on the northern shores of Garamond, and is also home to the planet's largest spaceport and transoceanic port. Gladius AquaLines, the planet's largest cruise line operator, offers weekly cruise services out of Hyacles that can take passengers as far away as the Burmaise Isles, in the southern hemisphere.

    <Description>A small world of terrestrial features, blessed with abundant resources, it is rather surprising in hindsight to know that this world was completely overlooked in the early years of colonization. With three large landmasses claiming most of the northern hemisphere, and deep, island-speckled oceans in the south, this cool world was a paradise just waiting to be discovered. In truth, infighting among the various private interests who were to mount the first expedition to Glengarry, complicated by the increasing friction between the Terran Alliance and its far-flung colonies, disrupted any efforts to settle the planet during the early days of humanity�s expansion among the stars. &#xD; To make matters worse, later surveys revealed dangerously high levels of arsenic and cyanide gases in the atmosphere, which first had to be cleansed in order to make the planet suitable for colonization. These factors kept settlers away until the early days of the Star League, when terraforming efforts by the nearby Federation of Skye finally cleansed the atmosphere of its toxic chemicals. Glengarry�s first settlers hailed from a mix of Scottish, Norwegian, and Canadian origins, both native to Terra and from among the Skye Federation�s populace. &#xD; Drawn originally to the continent of Scotia, the smallest of the three northern hemispheric landmasses, by its abundant ore resources in the mountain ranges, and the fertile soils of the valleys and lowlands, these colonists quickly established strict development guidelines to preserve the planet�s native splendor. Similar to the �zoning laws� used in other Federation worlds, such as Skye itself, the colonists created a self-perpetuating standard that has left the larger two continents, Dalraida and Pictland, virtually uninhabited even today, while Scotia eventually became a well-balanced center for light industrial, commercial, and agricultural development.&#xD; Glengarry�s trade with neighboring worlds boomed during the peak of the Star League era, specializing in a variety of locally produced items, but when the League fell and wars ignited across the Inner Sphere, the economy virtually collapsed. Efforts to relieve the planet�s economic woes by opening up the other two continents faltered, in part because of these continents� harsher winter climates, and because of the predation of deep raiders from the Draconis Combine and Free Worlds League.&#xD; Under the united Federated Commonwealth, Glengarry showed signs of economic recovery, particularly in the later years of the alliance, when it became the homeworld of the legendary Gray Death Legion.&#xD; The capital of Dunkeld is nearly as big as any capital city on the major worlds of the Inner Sphere, including even New Avalon or Luthien or Tharkad, but appearances are deceiving. It�s population, like that of the whole planet, has been declining steadily for generations. Dunkeld still possesses the vestiges of Glengarry�s one time greatness, things like the fine architecture of the Municipal Center in the heart of the town, or the massive bulk of the old Star League fortifications on Castle Hill.</Description>

    <Description>During the Amaris Crisis, the Greenhaven Gestapo (mercenaries of the worst sort), decided to put the entire College of Cardinals on trial, in a cynical attempt to extort more riches from the Catholic Church. In desperation, the Vatican managed to broadcast a short message to the ranking church members throughout the Inner Sphere.&#xD; The message read that his Holy Father was setting aside the mantle of the Church for the duration of the emergency in an attempt to avoid further violence. He gave the cardinals in the capitals of the five member-states certain powers needed to carry on the workings of the Church until such time when he could resume his position.&#xD; Cardinal Kinsey de Medici of New Avalon never received key parts of the message because a burst of static briefly interrupted the transmission. In one of those fateful quirks of history, the Cardinal interpreted what he did understand as a command that he alone was to assume complete control over the Catholic Church. A pious but egocentric man, Cardinal Medici proclaimed himself Pope Thomas X on December 15 2772, after hearing the news that Pope Clemont and almost everyone else in the Vatican had been murdered by the Greenhaven Gestapo.&#xD; Five months after Terra was recovered in 2779, Cardinal Vladimir Kosiv of the People's Union of Kazkakh was elected Pope John Paul V. For the second time in history, there were two Catholic Churches, with two Popes competing for allegiance.&#xD; Though many efforts have been made to reconcile the rift, all have failed. On individual planets, the conflict between the two churches tended to be anything but a sane and civil debate. On many worlds, the Catholic community was split down the middle and the question was settled, more often then not, with blood. On worlds such as Goderich, clashes between the two factions grew so intense that the planetary government was forced to call upon the Davion military for help.&#xD; Today, an uneasy truce exists between the two churches. The Roman Catholic Church recognizes the New Avalon Catholic Church as a wayward flock, and every few years sends a cardinal to New Avalon to negotiate reconciliation. The NACC, on the other hand, sees the RCC as the lost and confused one. Its leaders occasionally send one of their cardinals to Terra in an attempt to win its rivals over to the NACC.</Description>

Originally founded by a pair of retired AFFS generals who were tired of seeing of the quality of the soldiers on the Capellan Front plummet, the school began life as the Goshen BattleMech Academy. As more and more students were attracted to the school, the founders added staff and courses. Within a decade,  the newly renamed War College of Goshen was teaching almost every combat specialty to students from across the realm.&#xD; Generals Alexander and Truscott set out to build an academy that taught cadets how to be not only great soldiers but also great thinkers. The College's curriculum includes a heavy course load of military history and classic and contemporary military strategy. Students spend far more time dissecting the methodologies of great military leaders than they do on their specialty studies. By the time cadets participate in their first live-fire exercises, they exhibit an almost Zen-like connection with their 'Mech or vehicle and a prescience for the battlefield.&#xD; The War College is often called the AFFC's best-kept secret because it does not publicly recruit potential candidates as do the AFFC's other academies. Instead, the College's halls are kept full by word of mouth. Much like the Sakhara Academy, attendance at the War College is often is a "family affair," with generation after generation of soldiers sending their progeny there to receive what they consider the best education in the Inner Sphere.&#xD; Alumni scattered throughout the AFFC's bureaucracy ensure that the War College receives all the support it needs. Surprisingly, its commandant and staff require very little to keep the College operating. All of its primary training is accomplished using actual 'Mechs, vehicles and weapons on live-fire ranges.&#xD; The War College is led by retired Marshal Lawrence Marlowe.</Description>

    <Description>A Terra-like world with vast metal deposits, mineral wealth, and fossil fuel resources, Graham IV attracted the attention of several Terran manufacturing corporations looking to expand their facilities off-world. By the time of the Terran Hegemony, no fewer than six major corporations and a host of smaller ones had transformed the untamed wilderness of Graham IV into a sprawling series of heavily industrialized cities and factory complexes. &#xD; Two of these corporations, Dekirk Aerospace and Mitchell Vehicles, were primary contractors for the SLDF, their products included everything from conventional vehicles and aerospace fighters to BattleMechs and WarShips. The Star League even placed one of its rare orbital flight academies over Graham IV, to take advantage of prototype aerospace fighter designs coming out of the Dekirk Aerospace R&amp;D facility in Dekirk City.&#xD; For these reasons, unfortunately, Amaris' forces were particularly brutal in their efforts to seize the planet, resorting to widespread nuclear attacks to obliterate any of the factories and cities they could not capture. Today, the surface of Graham IV is a post-nuclear wasteland of radioactive craters and demolished cities. Only a few cities are left, either because they were too small and remote to be worth a nuclear strike, or because they were built after the devastation.&#xD; These cities, located far from the ruins on the marginally habitable continents of Barvionne and Palothica, are largely maintained by mining interests and small manufacturing operations that continue to exploit the few remaining lodes of Graham IV's resources which can be safely harnessed. The city of Keystone, on the southern reaches of Palothica, features the planet's primary spaceport, a corporate trade center for the surviving planetary companies, and even the garrison command for the planetary militia. A pair of large space habitats, placed around the planet by the Free Worlds League, support a healthy share of the planetary population now. One of these, dubbed New Dekirk City, serves as the planet's official capital in the sky.</Description>

    <Description>Graus was settled by a mixture of French, German and Spanish colonists who found the planet's striking beauty and modest natural resources a perfect fit, and before long a series of agrarian communities and light industries dotted the landscape on the planet's thickly forested primary continent of Albion. &#xD; Over time, a booming economy developed based in part on agriculture and in part on commercial products such as holovids, recreational vehicles and other civilian extravagances. Beginning in the late 2980s, however, a fundamentalist back-to-nature movement, sparked by widespread development and the predations of the Succession Wars, began to take root on this planet. &#xD; By 3007, this pacifistic, pro-agrarian movement had gained effective control over the planetary government and banished all heavy military forces, leaving a reformed planet-wide police department as the only deterrent against criminals and raiders. Though derided as foolish, this policy spared Graus any serious damage when the Jade Falcons arrived during the Clan invasion, and the planet was absorbed without a struggle. &#xD; The Clan civilian society meshed well with the neo-communal aspects of the new Grausian order, and despite several raids and assaults while under Clan rule, the planet has returned to the Lyran fold in surprisingly good shape. However, as with the recently liberated world of Blackjack, much of the local population clings tenaciously to the cultural mores imposed by the strict Jade Falcons, though the famed Grausian tendency toward pacifism has made reintegration into the Alliance somewhat easier here. &#xD; The capital of Graus is New Paris, and is located on the northern steppes of the Albion continent. The other major landmasses, Bromme and Gaulia, support a host of minor industries and agricultural communities that cluster near the shorelines, leaving the interiors of these equatorial continents to desert creatures, such as the Grausian bloodsucker and the scruffer.</Description>

Should a new Clan force enter along the Smoke Jaguar flank, or should the Jaguars decide to move laterally and devour more Combine space, only the Tenth Pesht Regulars on Gravenhage could prevent the fall of several nearby worlds. Gravenhage also makes a convenient jumping-off point for hitting the Jaguars along their rear, disrupting their supply lines and possibly their communications network. That a green regiment guards such a planet either speaks well for the Tenth's ability - or indicates that the High Command has no plans to launch a counter-offensive in this area in the near future.</Description>

    <Description>The initial survey of the young world of Great Gorge reported little of interest except for the dimensions of the huge canyon that dominates one of the regions. Most assumed that this planet of marginal atmosphere, little water, and few lifeforms would become a charted but forgotten world.  A religious group from Terra chose Great Gorge as the site of their future Eden. Settling on the planet just before the creation of the Star League, they set about to completely transform the world. Some of their activities, such as scattering desert grass seeds from airplanes and casting ironfish eggs into the sea, began to have surprising, even miraculous, effects. The oxygen content of the atmosphere increased because of the plants the colonists cultivated, and fish actually hatched and thrived on the native algae.  By the end of the Star League era, Great Gorge was a comfortable place with plenty of air and plenty of food, thanks entirely to the work of the planet's original colonists. In the meantime, several mining companies had discovered that the walls of the Great Gorge exposed many easily mined metals and chemical compounds. The planet soon became as profitable as it was habitable.  Unfortunately for Great Gorge, its location on the Crucis March border with the Periphery and its abundant resources have made it a prime target of bandit raids. Just recently, the last descendant of the planet's religious colonists died. Without their efforts to keep the planet livable, it is possible that conditions on Green Gorge, particularly its atmosphere, might decline to their previous state. The present Marquess definitely has his work cut out for him.  The capital of Great Gorge is New Stockdon, a city in the Wide Floor section of the Great Gorge.</Description>

    <Description>A good part of the planet Greeley is frozen arctic tundra. Its small sun and the exaggerated tilt of the planet's axis produce strong arctic blizzards that actually push their way into the planet's tropical regions to blanket most of the world in snow. Underneath the snow and soil are a few modest deposits of metals and little else.  Recent activity on the planet suggests that Greeley has suddenly become important to the Federated Suns. It appears that they are constructing a military base for BattleMechs, tanks, and infantry units. This new "Fort Greeley" is apparently going to play a role in the training of Davion troops. It is also known that several scientists from the NAIS are at Fort Greeley. Which may indicate that the fort will serve as an arctic test center for NAIS-designed devices. This planet definitely bears watching.</Description>

    <Description>Gulkana is currently the center of much political and religious unrest. A relatively small world with few resources, the planet would probably go unnoticed except for its one industry. The Yeffters Weapons Factory makes DropShip autocannons of all calibers. Most of its products go to Galax, where they are installed on the DropShips of Federated-Boeing.&#xD; When the Yeffters factory was shut down last year as the result of a political insurrection, everyone in the Federated Suns, including Prince Davion himself, sat up and took notice. The planet's democratic government had been usurped by a member of the planet's local militia. The nobility, including the weak and apathetic Duke Salos, was mollified with promises that their privileged positions were safe. Captain Yarborough, the new ruler of the civilian government, appeared to be a relatively reasonable man who promised to protect personal liberties and to lower taxes. It looked for a moment as though the change of governments had been for the better.&#xD; That opinion soon changed when Captain Yarborough proclaimed the Competency Laws, which used a farcical test to classify each inhabitant according to IC. Those who scored high were given important jobs; those who scored low were given shovels. Though the test was inaccurate and biased against the majority Hindu population, it was acceptable to Yarborough's fanatic and well-armed supporters. The effect of this lunacy was immediate. The entire planet ground to a complete halt, including the vital weapons industry.  Because certain laws prevent the Davion central government from interfering in the affairs of its nobles, the most Hanse Davion has been able to do was attempt to pressure the apathetic Duke Salos to make a stand. The aging Duke has resisted the Prince's pleas for action, however. Some of the planet's lesser nobility would like to use their private forces against Yarborough, but Duke Salos directly controls the major cities, which effectively protects the usurper. At the moment, there is a grass-roots movement dedicated to the overthrow of the crazed Captain and to seek assistance of the Davion government, but it has not been possible to mount a coordinated effort so far.&#xD; The capital city of Gulkana is Kanpur.&#xD; Finally, in 3033, Christine Salos assumed the Duchy of Gulkana from her father and called upon the AFFS to step in and help her fix the problems on her homeworld. It was years before order could be restored, but when Gulkana finally calmed down, Yeffters Weapons Factory began regularly supplying several Federated Suns defense contractors with its wares. While the odd pirate raid or resurgent rebel uprisings remain a threat, Gulkana now has a militia force capable of dealing with such crises.</Description>

    <Description>[3030] The third of the key Canopian campaigns during the joint Andurien-Canopus invasion of the Capellan Confederation in 3030, Gunthar showcased the poor Canopian understanding of Inner Sphere military operations. While employing mercenaries themselves, the MAF had little illusion as to their determination and reliability. They assumed that a mercenary force would rather break contract and run than be crippled � a perception reinforced by many of the mercenary forces that ended up in the Periphery � assuming, that is, a hefty bribe couldn�t persuade them to abandon their post in the first place. That they attempted to both bribe and intimidate the Fifteenth Dracon only underlined their folly.&#xD; The Fifteenth, originally part of the SLDF, had served the Confederation since Kerensky�s Exodus and, though technically mercenaries, were de facto house troops. A trait of the Dracon under their current commander, Samuel Shimosa, was the building of strong ties to the local community, and Gunthar was no exception. Expecting the Fifteenth to turn coat or to flee was thus never a realistic prospect, as the Third Canopian Fusiliers soon found to their cost. What was expected to be either a short, sharp campaign or a complete non-event turned into one of the longest and most hard-fought battles of the war.&#xD; The Fusiliers� landings were unopposed in November of 3030, and the Canopian troops set about preparing a defensive perimeter, though few expected to need the preparations. On 11 November, two days after the landing, Major Wilhelm Archal made his �proposal� to Colonel Shimosa, expecting to engage in a negotiation that transferred the world to Canopian control. The tirade he received from �Sir Samuel� shocked him, sounding more like an outraged Warrior House Master than a sell-sword. Even more surprising was the assault, some six hours later, on the bridgehead. Many of the MAF troops were asleep and wakened to the sound of battle and chaos. The Dracons, having moved into position over the previous days, came close to smashing the Fusiliers� position, with only the massed guns of their grounded DropShips preventing the mercenaries from pressing home their advantage. After two hours, the Dracon withdrew leaving the Canopian camp in disarray.&#xD; In the short, sharp engagement the Fusiliers lost over a company of �Mechs, a number of them destroyed while unpowered and parked, along with massive quantities of ammunition and supplies. Dracon losses were relatively light, which abruptly made the campaign much more evenly balanced. The mercenaries pulled back from the landing zone and began a series of raids designed to test the Canopian defenses and to draw the Fusiliers out from under the guns of their DropShips. Realizing the tenuous nature of his position, Major Archal refused to take the bait and dispatched several of his companies on counter raids, hoping to wear down the mercenaries while waiting for reinforcements.&#xD; The dug-in Canopians were initially loath to take the initiative, but as the weeks passed and the likelihood of reinforcements declined, their attacks against the Dracons increased in number and intensity. Meanwhile, the Dracons continued their probing attacks, soon coming to the conclusion that a conventional assault couldn�t dislodge the invaders. Instead, they deliberately engineered �weaknesses� in their own defenses in an attempt to lure the Fusiliers into committing to an assault, though once again Archal refused to bite, and on only two occasions were there large-scale clashes between the two forces.&#xD; On 7 April, a mercenary recon company stumbled into a Canopian light armor force that had been patrolling the perimeter. In the bloody nineteen-hour clash that ensued, six Dracon �Mechs were downed while more than twenty tanks were destroyed. The second and equally indecisive engagement came on 14 September as the invaders raided the Capellan stronghold of Riedam. Frustration at the lack of progress (and reinforcements) led to the operation, whose objective was to undermine the mercenary�s position by seizing key stockpiles of ammunition and food. The assault succeeded in its main objectives, torching warehouses and destroying large equipment, but the attack cost almost a company of �Mechs, losses the Fusiliers could ill afford as the stalemate slipped into its second year.&#xD; [3032] News of the Capellan counter-assault on Drozan and Betelgeuse in March 3032 galvanized both of the forces on Gunthar, the Third Canopian Fusiliers and the Fifteenth Dracon attacking each other with a ferocity hitherto unseen in the two-year campaign. It was too little too late, however, and on 19 June, with the alliance�s war plans in tatters, the MAF called back the Third Fusiliers. The Dracon would not, however, allow the Canopian unit to escape so easily. A surprise assault netted the mercenaries two MAF DropShips, placing the periphery force in an awkward position: although they had been mauled, they lacked the transport assets to evacuate everyone from Gunthar.&#xD; When efforts to retake the vessels failed and no commercial DropShips could be found to bolster the flotilla, the Third did the only thing they could. Packing as many �Mechs and vehicles into the transports they had � including slotting some into vacant fighter cubicles and tying them down in cargo space � the remaining forces, a company of tanks, were destroyed by the Fusiliers themselves rather than allow them to fall into Capellan hands. The remaining cramped DropShips limped for the jump point, the last vessel departing the system on 9 July.</Description>

The final bid was between Khan Natasha Kerensky and her Wolf spiders, and Star Colonel Marcos Radick and the Heel Snappers. Star Colonel Radick, still stinging after being low-balled by Natasha Kerensky at Memmingen, hoped to return the favor. Radick and all the observing Khans were stunned into silence when Kerensky offered to take the whole planet with just one man, star Commander Phelan Wolf. Phelan had been stationed on Gunzberg as part of the Kell Hounds and knew the planet's leader, General Tor Miraborg, very well, though he did not remember him fondly.&#xD; Tor was not only the charismatic leader of Gunzberg, but commander of all the Rasalhague forces in the Radstadt Province. He was also the father of Kapten Tyra Miraborg, the pilot whose suicide run against the Dire Wolf at Radstadt, resulted in the death of ilKhan Leo Showers. The idea that he could be won over by just one man seemed ludicrous, but Star Commander Phelan had the ability to tell the truth simply and without flinching. He told General Miraborg that his Gunzberg Eagles, Armor Regiment, and First and Second Mechanized Infantry Regiments would gain great glory if they chose to fight the Clans, but that they could not hope to win and would certainly be wiped out. He asked General Miraborg to weigh the glory against the pain and suffering that the battle would inflict on Gunzberg. Star Commander Phelan's appeal to Miraborg's concern for his people succeeded, and Gunzberg became part of the Wolf Occupation Zone without a shot being fired.&#xD; Shortalar City is the capital of Gunzburg.</Description>

Despite repeated calls for them to do so, the militia refused to surrender even though they were outnumbered more than five-to-one.&#xD; Running the militia to ground took several days but the last organized resistance ended on May 14th, with the final surviving militiaman finally surrendering a week later.</Description>

    <Description>When the news of the Marik-Liao invasion reached the planet Hall, the defending Forth Republican prepared to fend off an assault that never came. Instead of mounting a direct attack, Chancellor Sun-Tzu Liao directed his agents to foment a rebellion and so claim the world for the Capellan Confederation, but the Forth ruthlessly crushed the rebel movement. Though the Forth felt no particular loyalty to House Davion to justify its brutal actions, Hall's former status as part of the Tikonov Free Republic meant the unit loved the Capellan Confederation even less.&#xD; The Clan conflict left many rimward planets defended by green units and troops considered too unreliable for service on the front lines. Its history of vocal anti-Davion sentiment, discipline problems, and the current rumors of the unit recruiting out-of-work mercenaries after conducting only superficial background checks put the Forth firmly into the unreliable category. When Archon Katrina Steiner-Davion invited all Lyran units currently serving in the Sarna March to return to the new Lyran Alliance, the commander of the Forth Republican, Leftenant General William "Bud" Baranov, recognized the message hidden in the Archon's speech: the mighty Federated Commonwealth was breaking apart.&#xD; After a quick meeting with his officers, Baranov led his troops against the capital city of Harney, casually swatting the poorly organized opposition and crowning himself Emperor of Hall. Though the unit secured only the capital, most of the planet's populace fell in line out of fear of what the unpredictable commander would do next. Only Count McNally, who controlled a sizeable region of land east of the capital, possessed sufficient military strength and economic assets to counter Emperor Baranov. Convinced that Baranov's next move would be against him, Count McNally hired mercenaries from Outreach to augment his own 'Mech forces, then settled in to wait.&#xD; Emperor Baranov had too much trouble in his own court to worry much about McNally. Several of Baranov's men had rebelled against him, and the two sides skirmished almost daily in Harney's streets. A city untouched by the conflict since the First Succession War, Harney was rapidly falling to ruins. When Baranov finally drove the rebels outside Harney, that faction claimed several southern cities as its territory, and rumor has it that members of that faction have begun fighting amongst themselves.&#xD; All three sides continue to administer their small portions of Hall, occasionally fighting each other for supplies of territory. Emperor Baranov controls the only interstellar transport on Hall and uses it to conduct pirate raids in an effort to feed his troops and subjects. The Emperor is also attempting to gain sole control over the ComStar compound in Harney so that he can deny his enemies access to interstellar communication. ComStar continues to block these efforts, and so Count McNally regularly sends out messages requesting assistance from various members of the Free Worlds League in ending Emperor Baranov's reign.&#xD; Hall's annual precipitation is far below the average for Terra, which gives the planet several large deserts. Considered one of the most beautiful worlds in known space, Hall owes this reputation to the strange, compelling rock formations found in each of the planet's deserts. From the air, it can be seen that many of these formations consist of solid walls of rock about five meters thick and sometimes more than two hundred meters long and of varying heights. The most unique feature of these formations is that most of the rock walls run parallel to one another, creating a vast complex of hallways.</Description>

Halloran V is in an ice age, with glacial sheets that cover 35 percent of both hemispheres. Exportation of ice is one of Halloran V's two major industries. Halloran was selling icebergs at such a prodigious rate that many felt the planet would be without them in a century, which could have precipitated a major ecological crisis. Planetary officials finally listened to the advice and slowed the export rate. &#xD; Halloran V has three continents and two archipelagos. Chimera, the largest continent, is located in the equatorial zone, which is the most temperate of the landmasses. The largest city, Vanders, and the capital, Gethin, are located on Chimera in the large Shobol River valley. Seventy percent of the population lives on Chimera.&#xD; Newfoundland and Sunderland are in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. Both are mostly barren, frozen lands that produce the bulk of the planet's copper, the world's other major export. Tonka Li and Tonka Lu are large archipelagos that have been left mostly undeveloped because of numerous active volcanoes.</Description>

    <Description>The founding of Halstead Station traces back to the early days of human expansion, when the growing Ozawa Mercantile Association sought to ensure its dominion of the �northwest� region of the galaxy, through a chain of stations under its complete control. Unfortunately, the system chosen for one of the way stations lacked one small requirement: a habitable world. &#xD; Because it was rich in minerals, particularly in the asteroid belt and on the third planet, a poisonous rock encased in a deadly argon-cyanide atmosphere, the system could not be ignored as a candidate. Engineers under the command of Geoffrey Halstead, one of the Association�s more visionary directors, established Halstead Station in 2207 and renamed the world after their new colony. &#xD; Halstead Station, more than merely a domed settlement on a poisonous wasteland, was actually a labyrinth of underground tunnels; huge surface and subsurface storehouses; and massive, environmentally sealed habitats that when completed, covered nearly three percent of the tiny planet�s surface. When the growing Draconis Combine finally crushed the Ozawas, Halstead Station, as one of the Association�s few surviving facilities, fell into the hands of House Kurita, which quickly assigned a significant portion of the ever-expanding facilities to military use.&#xD; Over the centuries, Halstead Station has seen use as a military supply base, a maximum-security prison, and a place where dishonored soldiers were sent to reflect upon their mistakes. Though Halstead Station continued to expand as extensive mining drilled out more underground tunnels, the quality of life for its inhabitants gradually began to decline. &#xD; The world is most famous for the events of 3013, the so-called �Battle of Halstead Station.� At the very beginning of Prince Hanse Davion�s reign, the MIIO reported that Combine construction crews had stumbled across the ruins of a Star League-era university housing a huge, unopened vault. Realizing how important the contents of that vault might be, Hanse rushed ahead with the raid plans and decided to personally lead the attack.&#xD; What was planned as a simple objective raid, turned into a month long battle, but luck was with the young Prince, however. When Prince Davion�s �Mechs broke into the vault, he and his men found rows upon rows of books and computer memory cubes. Hanse and his troops carried off as many of the books as time would permit, burning what they could not carry. Unofficial sources say that over three thousand books and other materials were taken away from the vault, most of them on highly technical subjects.&#xD; The Halstead Collection, as it came to be known, formed the centerpiece of the Prince�s ideas for the New Avalon Institute of Science. Today, the Halstead Collection is housed in the NAIS in an environmentally controlled library.</Description>

    <Description>Hamal is a cold desert world dominated by arid, frozen tundra and windstorms the locals call "sand blizzards." Settlers from the highlands of Terra's South American continent established their only major city, Califa Hamal, on the planet's equator, where temperatures can reach above freezing. Hamal's surface is a single landmass with small, landlocked seas containing mostly crushed ice. Hamal served as one of three provincial capitals in the early days of the Tikonov Union. However, by the time the Tikonov Union joined the Capellan Confederation, Hamal's importance was supplanted by more habitable worlds with greater resources and larger populations. The Terran Hegemony agreed to incorporate the increasingly backwards planet. &#xD; Aside from a small bureaucracy at Califa, most of Hamal's population carries out a nomadic, tribal existence to this day, and follows the growth of Hamal's meager vegetation as the seasons change. After the fall of the First Star League, the Capellan Confederation claimed Hamal. House Liao lost Hamal to the Federated Suns during the Fourth Succession War, but not before Hamal's expert desert fighters earned the respect of House Davion.</Description>

Matters were not helped by the brutal military governor General Forlough. By winter 2581, the ranks of the Alliance militia had swollen to thousands of individuals who wanted nothing more than to pay back the invaders in their kind.&#xD; The first to feel the effects of this new patriotic zeal were the troopers of the 37th Brigade of the 5th Corps, who landed on Haynesville in February 2582. After securing the planets water purification plant, the 37th was suddenly surrounded by hordes of militiamen under the command of Captain Joshua March. A senior officer in Pitcairn's Legion, March had spent the winter months training his charges in anti-'Mech warfare. With mortars and missile launchers, March's group managed to prevent the 37th from expanding its foothold on the planet.&#xD; In March 2582, the arrival of the Pitcairn Legion on Haynesville sealed the fate of the 37th. March pressed his advantage by launching a series of attacks to simulate a larger force than he actually had. Though a gamble, His bluff worked. With Brigade losses approaching 25% by the end of the month, with available stores running low, and with no chance of acquiring food from the locals, Brigade Commander Thomas Sexton was convinced that he faced overwhelming odds. Under a flag of truce, he began negotiations with March's representatives. Forty-eight hours later, a scant two days before a relief force headed by Forlough himself arrived on the scene, Sexton capitulated to his Haynesville opponents.&#xD; Quickly loading up all the captured 'Mechs and munitions that he could, March departed Haynesville three hours ahead of the arrival of Forlough's advance scouts, leaving Sexton and the now-unarmed 37th to their fate. (Forlough later tried and executed Sexton for his "cowardice under fire.") News of Sexton's surrender sent ripples throughout the Periphery. For the first time, a collection of farmers and merchants had overcome Star League troops.</Description>

This non-mammalian shark-like predator can grow to approximately four times the size of Terra's Great White, and dominates the waters of Helen's southern hemisphere. &#xD; In the days of the Star League, a sophisticated, floating marine life research platform dubbed Aquanis once studied the rich undersea wildlife of this world, but was sunk during the invasions brought on after the fall of the Star League. Rediscovered almost three kilometers below the surface of the North Helenic Ocean, off the coast of the Persephonie continent, this "sunken city" has become one of Helen's major tourist attractions. The planetary capital of Konstance is located on Joppa, the largest of Helen's continents, along with the bulk of the planet's lumber industries, the spaceport city of Corinth, and the military capital of Montague.</Description>

Later investigations turned up evidence that not only were the Scourge of Death responsible for the assassinations, but the House Selaj, rulers of the Principality of Regulus, had provided equipment, transportation, and training for the terrorist band.&#xD; A military tribunal convicted three members of House Selaj of treason and sentenced them to death, in absentia. Meanwhile, House Selaj placed the Regulan Hussars on full military alert. After Rajneesh Selaj paid a personal visit to the Regulan Hussars to earnestly proclaim his innocence, he won their full support.&#xD; In December 2669, Gerald Marik's forces invaded the Principality, after winning a promise from the other members of the Star League that they would not interfere. When six regiments of the Marik Militia attacked Hellos Minor, homeworld of D'mir Selaj, the Regulan Hussars valiantly held them off for almost a month. As the Hussars were gradually driven back, however, many soldiers began to defect. Rather than be captured, D'mir committed suicide at his country estate as the Marik troops forced their way inside.&#xD; Two weeks after the fall of Hellos Minor, the Marik forces also took the planet of Harmony. At this point, the remaining members of the Selaj family thought it prudent to seek refuge the Magistracy of Canopus.</Description>

    <Description>Helm is not a pleasant place for man, lying on the outer fringes of its stars habitable zone. More than half of the planet's surface is locked beneath glaciers kilometers deep. Vast stretches of what had once been ocean floor were dry and bare, with much of the water now locked in Helm's ice caps. Much of the land that remained was either mountainous or desert. Between the relentless, endless seas of ice to the north and south, ice-capped mountains thousands of meters high girdle Helm at the equator. &#xD; Yet life had evolved on Helm ages before, in an epoch when Helm's star was brighter and warmer. Life had continued by adapting to the cold. The planet had been discovered and colonized late in the 22nd century. The capital city of Freeport had grown up around the starport on a bluff overlooking the salt flats of a dried equatorial sea. For a time, Freeport had served as a Star League naval base, then as a storehouse for Star League weapons. In 2788, however, Minoru Kurita unleashed nuclear firestorms over Freeport and the other major settlements on Helm in an attempt to destroy or seize those stores. Within a single day, the population of Helm was reduced from over 100 million to a handful of starving wretches huddled around campfires in the wilderness. Kurita learned that the weapons stockpiles he was seeking had been transported elsewhere, and departed.&#xD; As the Star League fell, Major Edwin Keeler, the senior SLDF commander on Helm, tried to delay the various Marik commander's attempts to remove the cache by suggesting that they amongst themselves who had the proper authority to remove the cache. By invoking chapter and verse certain military articles, he was able to stop them walking in and carrying everything off. To stop the weapons falling into the wrong hands, Major Keeler and his battalion of Star League engineers moved the cache to the Star League's Nagayan Mountain's facility. Initially created with an eye towards being an underground laboratory, the project was later redirected to creating a Castle Brian-esq impregnable fortress. Though Keeler was not the first engineer to work on the project, he was the most successful. Mere weeks before Minuro Kurita arrived at Helm, he was able to transfer the entire weapons cache to the underground facility.&#xD; It took over three centuries for the planet to even begin to recover. By the 31st century, Helm was part of the Duchy of Stewart. The planets population is now divided between numerous  villages and small farming communities rather than cities, scattered among the valleys and plateaus of the equatorial mountains. With its small population and non-existent industrial base, Helm was an ideal landhold for MechWarriors in the service of House Marik.&#xD; Today the majority Helmans are farmers. An AgroMech planet outside Helmdown produces small, four-legged Harvester and Planter 'Mechs that are used locally, and another plant produces commercial hovercraft in small numbers. Helmdown itself, is an untidy sprawl, more of a village than a city, but is current capital and primary starport on Helm. What little industry that exists on the world is centered here. Trader DropShips come infrequently to the starport to barter for offworld manufactured goods. Wheat, ice plums and ferris grass - a tough fast-growing nutritious grain from the Highland plateau's - are Helm's only exports.&#xD; In 3027, the Nagayan Mountain complex was re-discovered by the Gray Death Legion. Implicated in a plot to brand them outlaws by rogue ComStar Precentor Rachan and a group of Marik nobles, Colonel Grayson Death Carlyle discovered the greatest treasure of all within the facility - a working Star League Field Library core. Once based in important cities of worlds across the Inner Sphere, very few have survived to the present day due to the holocausts of the First and Second Succession Wars, and none of these few are completely intact. Colonel Carlyle was able to copy the memory core and escape with some of the contents of the cache prior to the facilities destruction. Copies of the so-called Gray Death memory core slowly found their way around the Inner Sphere, eventually leading to the renaissance of technology.</Description>

    <Description>A temperate world of abundant water as well as native plant and animal life, Herotitus is far more pleasant than most independent Periphery worlds and certainly a far nicer place for today’s mercenary to do business on the fringes. With mild seasons and long growing cycles, much of the world’s land — particularly in the northern continents of Baccali and Pomona — has been given over to the local farming and ranching industries. The more developed southern continent of Marpessa, by comparison, is better known for its majestic mountains and steep canyons, both of which draw an ample tourist trade already well supported by the presence of most of the planet’s major cities nearby — including the planetary capital of New Hedon.&#xD; Originally founded jointly by the Taurian Concordat and the Magistracy of Canopus just prior to the Reunification War, Herotitus became one of the earliest and greatest examples of Canopian-Taurian cooperation in history, a quaint agrarian idyll of minimal industrial capacity or military value. After the Star League’s fall, the Taurian, Canopian, and Capellan governments all claimed Herotitus for themselves, but the planet’s utter lack of military resources spared it the worst of the Succession Wars. Its proximity to several larger states also kept piracy to a minimum, preserving the planet from damage beyond that of the occasional raid.&#xD; At the close of the thirtieth century, the New Hedons, a philosophical dissident sect from the Taurian Concordat, landed on Herotitus and quickly dominated the local economic and political landscape through sheer numbers and the allure of their simple “eat, drink, and be merry” philosophy. Over the next fifty years, the New Hedons transformed Herotitus from a simple agro world into a center for a host of thriving pleasure industries rivaled only by those of the&#xD;Magistracy of Canopus itself. The draw of its many resorts and casinos, catering to every sensual pleasure imaginable, brought with it an economic boom and increased trade between the planet and the neighboring states.&#xD; Although the pleasure industry remains strong and viable in the cities, however, the culture of the New Hedonists has recently begun to decline as a more puritanical Christian fundamentalism has taken root among the outlying farming communities and is even now working its way into the cities. The recent election of Allison Carver, a devout Catholic, to the planetary presidency, has worried many of the planet’s New Hedonist leadership so much that many are openly wondering if the movement will have to find a new home elsewhere — a prospect that has many locals in both the government and the entertainment industry worried.&#xD; Having gone out of its way to avoid significant military presence ever since its founding — despite brief periods of occupation by foreign neighbors — Herotitus’ status as a center for trade and recreation has made it a natural draw for mercenaries and potential employers alike. Thanks to its central location between five major states (three Great Houses and two large Periphery realms), its policy of openness to all visitors, and its liberal laws since the early part of the century, Herotitus has become a convenient waystation for travelers, traders, and Periphery-based mercenaries.&#xD; As a result, the world has undergone a massive population boom over the last four decades, with the latest census figures — taken in 3065 — finding nearly 17 million people now living in the scattered cities and towns across the planet, a far cry from the 240,000 estimated in 3025. (Local fundamentalist officials are quick to point out that in the 3020s, next to no formal system for measuring the population existed on Herotitus, leading to such gross errors that it crippled the planetary tax base. To the fundamentalists, this served as yet another proof that the New Hedonist party, for the sake of the economy as well as the souls of the people, should abandon its “inherently flawed” philosophies.)&#xD; New Hedon, the capital city, forms the informal center of this world’s unofficial mercenary trade, with hotels, casinos, conference centers, and even the local HPG station all possible venues for mercenaries and employer representatives to meet. The planetary spaceport, located in the heart of the city, is not equipped for military traffic, however. Thus, mercenaries with heavy equipment — including BattleMechs — must keep such gear stowed during their stay in New Hedon and make use of the city’s high-priced local transportation.&#xD; In the suburbs of Myrmos, on the outskirts of New Hedon, there are some informal training centers available to military personnel and mercenaries, which rely on antiquated simulator pods. These facilities — colloquially dubbed “the Arcade” — form the core of an unofficial school and exposition center for professional soldiers, and it is often here that prospective employers gauge the abilities of any local talent. Occasional simulator duels are even fought in Myrmos, giving rise to a feeble secondary gambling and gaming economy tailored to combat aficionados. Additionally, many mercenary commanders on Herotitus are known to scope Myrmos and its Arcade for new recruits.&#xD; Close to half the mercenary trade conducted on Herotitus occurs in New Hedon and Myrmos, with the rest taking place in the handful of smaller cities scattered across the planet. Ironically, though no shortage of trained warriors pass through the spaceports and cities of this world, a large percentage of the mercenaries recruited here tend to fill supporting roles in their new commands. Indeed, a recent MRBC study revealed that medical and technical specialists hired on Herotitus tend to be among the best in the industry.</Description>

    <Description>Hesperus II has been characterized as having about as much physical appeal as an 80-year old lady of easy virtue. Approaching the planet, the visitor immediately notices the innumerable mountain ranges and canyons crisscrossing the four major continents like wrinkles or the grids of some warped game board.&#xD; And a game board it has been, for Hesperus, with its huge BattleMech factory in the Myoo Mountains on the planet's South Whitman continent, is the crux of the Commonwealth's military strength. It has been attacked 14 times by enemy Houses, but all attempts to destroy the factory have so far failed. The terrain of Hesperus is unforgiving and has proven to be as much an obstacle to foreign attackers as have the planet's defenders.&#xD; Even attacks from orbit have failed. In March 2789, the third battle for Hesperus II occurred when Marik warships attempted to bombard the factories from orbit. Approaching the planet from an unusual vector to try and slip past the system defenses, the Marik fleet was unaware that the Commonwealth has assigned two of its own warships to defend the planet.&#xD; The FWLS Devastator and Skulker were soon embroiled in combat with the LCS Granite and Endeavor. The Devastator quickly got the better of the older Granite. The commander of the Granite, Fleet Admiral Deway, soon realized that the battle would be lost unless he could act quickly. The Admiral ordered the cruiser to ram the Devastator, with the prow of the Granite successfully breaching the side of the Devastator.&#xD; Unknown to both sides, the ramming of the collision had altered the ships orbits, and both were rapidly failing towards Hesperus. Though the Granite was able to un-entangle itself from the crippled Devastator, it had been too badly damaged in the battle to maneuver effectively. The ship, a veteran of the Reunification War was doomed. Admiral Deway gave the order to abandon ship, for pickup with the now victorious Endeavor. With no clear advantage over the Steiner fleet, the remaining Marik fleet withdrew.  &#xD; The hulks of the Granite and the Devastator both entered Hesperus's atmosphere, and although almost consumed in the fiery re-entry, huge chunks of the two ships eventually crashed very near the 'Mech factories.&#xD; Not much can grow on Hesperus II, except in the Melrose Valleys or in the terraced mountains just outside of Maria's Elegy, the largest city on Hesperus II. Due to the planet's lack of arable land, the population has always been small, consisting mainly of employees at the 'Mech factory.&#xD; [3025] Melrose Valley is the headquarters of Doering Electronics, a major manufacturer of BattleMech sensors and neurohelmets. One of its factories is based on Hesperus II and the other is on New Kyoto. Graf Umberto Doering is on good terms with Duke Brewer of Defiance Industries and probably hopes to win the hand of Jaqueline Brewer, the Duke's attractive daughter.</Description>

    <Description>[3031] Following their successful raids on Altorra and Fronde in late 3030 � as part of the joint Andurien-Canopian invasion of the Capellan Confederation - Carson�s Renegades struck deeper into the Confederation on a mission to sow chaos, this time targeting Hexare, midway between the capital and the St Ives Compact. As with the previous raids, the Renegades swiftly took charge of the world after a six-day campaign that scattered the Home Guard stationed there. Unlike the previous worlds, Hexare did not seek to surrender to the invaders but rather mounted a cool and defiant non-cooperation campaign, vowing that the Renegades would suffer when the Celestial Wisdom revealed his secret plans to crush them. The Renegades laughed at this, and with two more worlds on their hit-list � Hustaing and Carmen � set about commandeering supplies and equipment. The delay nearly cost them their lives.&#xD; Incensed by the strike so close to her capital, Romano Liao dispatched both battalions of the rebuilt Prefectorate Guard from their cantonment on Sian to chase down and destroy the Renegades. The Guards arrived at a pirate point in the Hexare system a scant eleven days after the Renegades� landing and succeeded in landing while the Renegades were still engaged in re-supply operations. The Guards� hopes for a surprise attack on the Andurien troops were scotched by the Renegades� interception of CCAF broadcasts, but the mercenaries could not complete their preparations to leave before the Capellan troops attacked. Leaving a battalion to oversee the re-supply, the main Renegades force deployed to meet the Liao troops.&#xD; The Guards showed little imagination, staging a frontal assault on the Renegades� line that they repulsed with ease. Counterattacking on a broad front despite their smaller numbers, the Renegades forced the Capellan unit to give ground, pushing them almost a kilometer further from the city before disengaging. The second CCAF assault was more cautious, a series of probes intended to identify weak spots in the Andurien line. Some of these were turned away violently, while other probes were allowed to overextend themselves before being crushed, and yet more were allowed to find �weak spots� that were subsequently reinforced (to the Guards� surprise) when they returned to exploit them. &#xD; Renegade flanking attacks kept the Guards off-balance while fake withdrawals lured Guards formations into killing zones. When the Renegades broke contact with the CCAF unit late on 14 March, the Capellan commander assumed it was another trick. Only when the Renegades� DropShips began to boost for orbit, their drive trails visible even to the Guards two-dozen kilometers away, did he realize that the trick was their escape.</Description>

    <Description>[3067] With factories located at Vogel on Hickok, Federated Industries is the largest producer of personal weapons and equipment in the Federated Suns. Originally founded as Federation National Firearms in 2724, it found some success with a number of handguns and long arms � enough to be bought out by no less than three different corporations in the next three decades, but not quite enough to remain a profitable subsidiary. After passing to the control of the Yorathil Corporation, though, the company struck it big with the FNF-LN rifle, the precursor to what is now known as the Federated Long Rifle.&#xD; The AFFS Department of the Quartermaster ordered 25,000 of the weapons immediately, and went on over the course of the next decade to order millions more, making it the standard long arm for its regular army infantry. Federation National Firearms became a wild success overnight, borrowing heavily on the strength of its military contracts to construct factories throughout the Federated Suns. By the time Amaris had seized control of the Terran Hegemony, the company was producing numerous weapons for the AFFS, from pistols to rifles to heavy support weapons.&#xD; The First and Second Succession Wars nearly destroyed the company, though, as weapons and ammunition factories were raided and bombed even while the AFFS needed even more weapons to prosecute those wars. With FNF production no longer able to keep up with demand, the Davion government contracted with local factories to build the exact same weapons that FNF designed. FNF came back strong in the early decades of the Third Succession War, however, with a new name and a new weapon. When Federated Arms debuted the Federated Long Rifle, the AFFS was looking for a new rifle for their infantry with better range and more hitting power. The rest, as they say, is history.&#xD; Federated Arms once more grew into a giant, ultimately entirely consuming what was left of the Yorathil Corporation and renaming the entire company to Federated Industries. The Federated Arms and Federated Armor divisions date from that time and have been the AFFS� largest supplier of small arms, support weapons, and body armor ever since. Federated Industries added Hurricane Defense Systems, a builder of heavier weapons and munitions, in 2948, expanding its business to provide every type of weapon or munitions the AFFS might need.&#xD; The purchase of Personal Defense Contractors in 2993 was, at the time, controversial. Officially, the company trained and equipped corporate security forces and personal bodyguards, and also provided those same security services to those that could afford their prices. Unofficially, the company specialized in providing elite mercenaries to petty nobles and others who sought to overthrow legitimate local rulers or engage in a truly hostile takeover. Since then, the company has become a constant performer, even in times of recession.&#xD; Federated Industries formed its final major division in 3043. For almost its entire history, the company had focused on producing conventional weapons. In fact, its only forays into lasers and other advanced weapons had been abysmal failures. Looking to turn that around and cash in on the bits of LosTech the NAIS had been unlocking every day, the company formed Federated-Barrett, initially tasking it as a high-tech R&amp;D house. This division was responsible for the very first personal Gauss weapons accepted by the AFFS, and especially the MagShot rifle integral to the Infiltrator Mk. II battle armor. As a result, in 3059 Federated-Barrett took on responsibility for not only research and development, but also production of all of Federated Industries� advanced light weapons, including Gauss weapons, lasers, and other energy weapons.</Description>

Philosophers throughout the ages have argued that the truest measure of a nation�s success is the breadth of its cultural traditions. Without stability and riches, the arts struggle; with them, they flourish.&#xD; Some artists create for art�s sake. Others create to sell. The Free Worlds has numerous examples of both, ranging from the ultra-modern to traditions that date back millennia. Sculpture and painting are perennial favorites, traditional stoneworking and oil-on-canvas works being complemented with plastics engineering, laser-etching and dynamic art.&#xD; Museums, galleries and private homes are the major venues for such works, but many corporations have come to regard art as a business investment and acquire it to decorate their halls and boardrooms. Other artworks in the League are on a scale almost unprecedented in history. Massive installations like the Rock Gardens of Hiratsuka cover several square kilometers.</Description>

    <Description>Hobbs is a relatively dry world whose native flora and fauna are confined to an extensive system of underground caverns that honeycomb the world. The caverns are host to an amazing ecosystem of animals, some of whose behavior borders on intelligence. The most advanced of the native lifeforms are the Takooma, vaguely apelike mammals with keen infrared vision and sense of smell. They travel in extended family groups and seem to have a rudimentary language, though scientists from the NAIS and other universities have yet to penetrate its secret.  The Federated Suns military uses the countless interconnected underground caverns of Hobbs as a kind of enormous warehouse, which has put the AFFS in direct conflict with the Takooma. The creatures have waged something akin to a guerrilla war against the alien Humans, ambushing anyone caught alone and stoning them to death. Soldiers who try to hunt down the Takooma often become lost in the maze of tunnels and end up becoming the hunted instead.  The capital city of Hobbs is Luray Caverns, one of many cavern-based cities on the planet.</Description>

    <Description>Hoff was originally settled for its agricultural possibilities. Its wide plains crisscrossed with small rivers and brooks offer excellent crop and grazing lands. Hoff's other modest resources of metals and coal deposits took a back seat to development of its potential as a farming world.  Early in 3019, a team from the NAIS came to Hoff to reopen the long abandoned Friden Aerospace Park on the planet's northern continent. The small spaceport had been cleaned up and turned into a test facility where NAIS scientists, including members of the famed Team Banzai, could field test new military technology. This made Hoff a prime target that the Draconis Combine did not delay in attacking. In 3022, the famous Wolf's Dragoons, then mercenaries in the Draconis Combine, attacked Hoff, where the equally famous Eridani Light Horse was on defense. Though the black 'Mechs of the Dragoons managed to seize the research facility, they were not quick enough to capture any of the scientists or the research projects they were testing.  Since then, the Federated Suns have reinforced Hoff, making it unlikely that the Kuritans will attempt another attack. Reports from our ComStar Precentorstate that Davion has reopened the Friden Aerospace Park and that Team Banzai has recently completed tests on a variant of the Hatchetman BattleMech.</Description>

    <Description>[3050] Clan Ghost Bear landed on Holmsbu in March 3050. Defending the world were the Seventh and Eighth Corrugated Lancers - 2 armored regiments supported by infantry. The Lancers were ill-prepared for a fight with battle-armored Elementals and fell quickly to the Clan troops' superior weapons and training. The Ghost Bears readily accepted the Lancers' surrender.&#xD; [3063] During the Ghost Bear invasion, the infamous Black Omen mercenaries - jumped at the opportunity to gain some retribution against their old enemies. From Wolcott, the Omen secretly penetrated the Dominion and waged a McCarron�s-style campaign against the worlds of Pinnacle, Holmsbu, and Thule, disabling each planet�s HPG and destroying munitions depots along the way.</Description>

The Fifth Regulan Hussars brought Holt into the fold in September 3014, as they moved from their garrison post on Ventabren towards the Marik Commonwealth border.&#xD; Following the rebel disaster on Calloway VI, the Stewart Dragoons Home Guard and the Head Hunters pursued the Fifth Regulan Hussars to Holt, landing in December 3015. Still smarting from being so easily ejected from Abadan, the Hussars launched an ill-conceived attack that ran afoul of two supporting loyalist regiments of heavy armor. Their line broken, the Hussars tried to pull back, but the Home Guard proved impossible to shake off. The end came when the Head Hunters skirted the rebel flank and tore up the Hussars� command company. In the following confusion only four ragged companies of the Fifth Regulan Hussars retreated with the Second Ducal Guard.&#xD; [3025] Since the signing of the Concord of Kapteyn, the Free Worlds League has opened up its trade routes with the Capellan Confederation.

Yet just a day before they entered Homam orbit, they received orders from New Avalon to hold all Wave Two operations. &#xD; So when they arrived in orbit on 24 August, Petersen placed most of his DropShips in a variety of parking orbits that would allow them to intercept any ships attempting to either leave or reach the planet. He did land approximately two battalions of mixed forces on the planet�a move that the High Command would later categorize a �reconnaissance in force� and thus not a technical violation of orders. &#xD; The world was all but undefended, and Petersen�s �reconnaissance� forces � he rotated mixed battalions through the operation every few days, giving his troops both combat experience and the chance to get their �land legs� under them again � ranged across the face of the world for three weeks before the General finally received direct orders to withdraw to David. The ELH left the Homam system on 7 September, having all but destroyed the world�s defending forces, but showing nothing else for the effort.</Description>

This amazingly eclectic school is the product of a cooperative that sprang up around a vacation retreat on this beautiful, lush world.&#xD; Thornton Hyadil and Muhren Dahl, professors of philosophy and economics at the Olafvik's Maarakiva University, often vacationed on Home, building castles in the air and demolishing present-day economic and philosophical practice. Others on recreational leave shared their enthusiasm for Home, and they made a pact to return there at regular intervals and practice cloud-building. The group grew to several dozen persons, who attracted small following of their own. The meetings grew more regulated, and eventually the group hung out its shingle, choosing the unorthodox name of "Kira Place".&#xD; It is a point of pride that Kira Place is still relatively unstructured, encouraging the loose, informal discussions that its founders so enjoyed. Hyadil still maintains that Kira place is the only place in the Free Worlds where one will hear original thought untainted by official regulation and timetables.</Description>

When the local garrison found it impossible to keep order, the garrison commander called for assistance. Having failed to study the situation carefully, the Regulan High Command reacted in the usual manner by sending in conventional reinforcements that included 'Mechs.&#xD; These new troops learned the lessons of guerrilla warfare in the steamy jungles of Hongqiao. Conventional patrols never found the enemy, while terror tactics only hardened the populace toward their rulers. Two years passed before the generals admitted their failure, and many people died before the lesson was learned. Eventually, the Regulan authority was forced to rescind its new taxes, and pull its provincial forces offworld.</Description>

    <HasFactory>false</HasFactory>
    <Description>First colonized for its vast mineral deposits and metal ore veins, Hot Springs became famous for its rich mineral water. The planet developed a tourist industry centered on the mineral enriched water and therapeutic hot springs. Tourists from across the Inner Sphere would journey to Hot Springs just to take "the baths," as they were called. The planet is primarily populated by the descendants of African and Black Americans, who emigrated from Terra in the latter half of the 28th century. &#xD; Hot springs, however, was far from a resort world. The planet's two continents are the results of massive volcanic activity. Silver Springs, the larger of the two continents, is mostly covered in black crusty rock-ash, broken by the occasional outcropping of trees, a smattering of dense jungle or small lakes of brackish water. The Lucas Mountain Range found on the western side of Silver Springs, is part of the volcano mountain chain that formed the planet's continents.&#xD; Manta Springs is the less hostile of the two lava-strewn landmasses. The majority of the planet's population settled Manta Springs. The planetary capital, Boulder, was built from the rocky terrain. Here in the capital is the Institute for Advanced Studies in Physical Therapy. It is here that many people come to learn special training in therapeutic methods of physical therapy and limb rehabilitation training.&#xD; [3050] Clan Jade Falcon targeted the world of Hot Springs for a reason only recently made known: the founder of the Von Jankmon Bloodname was also born on that planet. Many members of that Bloodname held powerful positions in the Clan touman and convinced Khan Crichell to add Hot Springs to the invasion list in June 3050.&#xD; The green troops of the Hot Springs TMM stood little chance against the fighters and OmniMechs of the Turkina Keshik, who advanced steadily from the spaceport, swatting aside the few conventional fighters and VTOL's that attempted to block their progress. The militia made its stand at the planetary capital, choosing the only position that could give the man advantage: the Falcons were reluctant to launch an all-out attack, because their orders were to take the city with minimum damage.&#xD; Elementals formed the frontline force and made their way slowly through the streets, destroying tanks and pillboxes, routing the militia infantry, and eventually forcing the Hot Springs TMM 'Mechs units from their prepared positions. The Falcons allowed the militia to break out of the city, but stopped the defenders from reaching the world's wilderness areas, where they could organize guerrilla operations. The First Falcon Striker Cluster were in position to trap the militia as they escaped from the capital, and less than thirty minutes later, the last of the militia fell to the overwhelming firepower of Clan Jade Falcon.&#xD; [3064] During the Jade Falcon Incursion, General Steiner and forces landed on Hot Springs on the 21st September 3064. Star Colonel Diane Anu and her fifth Battle Cluster kept Steiner tied up for some time, however, using Inner sphere-like tactics against the Lyran troops. By going to ground, and running a hit-and-run campaign, Anu prevented Steiner from using overwhelming force against her and further kept the general from launching any more assaults within the Falcon OZ until the second week of December. General Adam Steiner pulled off Hot Springs on the 12th of December, leaving the world in Falcon hands.</Description>

    <Description>When Hanse Davion struck at the Capellan Confederation in 3028 using the combined might and wealth of the newly announced Federated Commonwealth and began the conflict known as the Forth Succession War, the planet Hsien, along with several other worlds, was temporarily cut off from its parent realm, the Capellan Confederation. When Pavel Ridzik, a top commander in the military of the Confederation, turned traitor to his nation and convinced those separate worlds to join him in forming the Tikonov Free Republic, Davion spared the fledgling nation his bloody conflict. Shortly after the end of the Forth Succession War, Tikonov voted to join its fortunes to the might of the FedCom. Hsien remained peaceful after the war and eventually gained a limited propensity as House Steiner encouraged its lumber and canning industries. The Marik-Liao invasion abruptly ended the planet's slow economic growth.&#xD; The only unit stationed on Hsien at the onset of the invasion was the Second F-C RCT, a unit considered fanatically loyal to House Davion. Though determined to hold the world against the Liao assault, the Second RCT quickly fell to the First and Second regiments of McCarron's Armored Cavalry. Marshal Irene Thome led the Second in a retreat offworld to Elgin, where she hoped to refit and resupply and return to Hsien. Unfortunately for the Second, the Free Worlds League mercenary unit Swann's Cavaliers, sent to aid the Capellan rebellion on Elgin, destroyed all of the Second but the command lance.&#xD; As soon as the units of McCarron's Armored Cavalry established the rule of Capellan governor Robert Thomay, they moved on to a new assignment. Their departure gave Baron Luis Montong V, the scion of the only family on Hsien of noble rank, the courage to reject Hsien's "upstart government" and declare his continuing loyalty to the Federated Commonwealth.&#xD; When Governor Thomay traveled to the island continent of Chone to meet with Baron Montong and enlist that powerful man's support for the new government, the baron treated the governor with great respect. He pledged to the governor the loyalty of his people and his personal cooperation, thereby guaranteeing Hsien's complete subjugation to House Liao. When the Capellan turned to leave, the baron drew his laser pistol and shot Governor Thomay in the back, then ordered his troops to throw the governor's entourage in prison. Baron Montong then proclaimed that, regardless of the decision the rest of the planet chose to make, his holdings still belonged to the Federated Commonwealth and that his loyalty remained with the Archon Prince.&#xD;&#xD;The remaining populace of Hsien quickly severed all connection to Montong and most fully supported the new Capellan governor elected a short time later, though only one month after Baron Montong's declaration the province of Dendeez seceded from the Capellan government. All three realms continue to exist, though they plague each other with daily skirmishes. The time and energy the respective governments devote to devising outrageous and complex trade compacts have slowed the exchange of goods to a trickle, but the situation is not yet critical. Though Baron Montong sends repeated pleas to Archon-Prince Steiner-Davion for assistance in his efforts to smash the two rival realms, Prince Victor has not answered those requests. The balance of power on Hsien seems likely to remain stable for the foreseeable future.</Description>

The planet's atmosphere is tainted by tons of sulfur vapor produced by hundreds of volcanoes located on the main continent in the equatorial zone of the planet. "Hell," as it has been named, is completely devoid of life. &#xD; The population of the planet lives in Kamala, the only continent that can support life. And that's not saying much. Even here the landscape is a frozen lava flow, reddish-brown in color, with half-melted purple hillsides. Pale yellow vapors twist from sulfurous, steam-belching geysers, rising through the thick brown soup.&#xD; Outside the capital of Hunan City are the Hellfire Mountains, which are made up of volcanoes and hot springs that make the use of infrared scans nearly impossible. The sulfur vapors hamper radar and magscans, making most sensors useless.&#xD; The planet was colonized only for the massive deposits of ore and metals found on all five of the planet's continents. Roc, Zeka, and Bandar are island continents. It was here that the planet's native life was found. "Fire lizards," as they were called, could spit a caustic liquid with deadly accuracy up to 10 meters, causing intense burns. Eventually the lizard population was brought under control and a few domed cities were built so that humans could mine the land.</Description>

    <Description>Outside of Steiner space and beyond the young realm known as the Rim Collection, lies a unique relic of a bygone era. During the height of the Star League, an exploration ship searching for likely mining sites discovered in the Periphery a beautiful planet teeming with life. The blue skies and sweet air of this new world seemed a sure sign that the planet offered ideal conditions for colonists and tourists alike. As the explorers quickly learned, the planet was home to thousands of species of unique animals, nearly all predators. Scientists still debate the whys and wherefores of such an anomalous situation, but accept that the smaller predators simply serve as prey for the larger predators. Creatures so dangerous and powerful that they might overwhelm a BattleMech occupy the top of the food chain.&#xD; Though poor in gems and metals, the planet proved to be a biological gold mine for its discoverers. The exploration team quickly hatched a plan to market the new world as a big-game hunter's dream come true. Attempts to establish a surface settlement failed completely, so investors funded the construction of an orbital space station. DropShips would bring wealthy thrill seekers to the station, where they would meet their guides with the latest in weaponry and survival gear. The richest hunters could even go to the surface piloting 'Mechs. The beasts they caught live would become the main attractions of zoos throughout they Inner Sphere, though most targets ended up stuffed and mounted in dusty trophy rooms.&#xD; The so-called Hunter's Paradise prospered for several decades. When trouble started brewing in the Periphery, however, business slacked off. And, as with so many other ventures, the collapse of the Star League spelled the doom of this high-priced resort. Eventually the space station was abandoned and forgotten.&#xD; When Collection scouts rediscovered the world and its abandoned jump station, President Moroney immediately poured what resources he could into reactivating the station and building the infrastructure to reopen the hunter's resort. Realizing his nation did not have the capability to completely reopen the world as it once was, he settled with the exportation of exotic animals to interstellar zoos, primarily those in the Lyran Alliance.&#xD; [3062] Within a year of Councilman Robert's elevation to president, he put Moroney's plan to reopen the world into action. Now open for more than two and a half years, the world is just beginning to attract the interstellar clientele it once did, with all trade passing straight through the rim collection. By all accounts, several Clansmen have even made their way covertly to the world to test their mettle against the dangerous world.&#xD; Unfortunately, with the FedCom Civil War already spiraling out of control and the rest of the Inner Sphere apparently becoming caught up in a new age of war, the future of this Rim Collection protectorate remains uncertain. For now, though, it is rapidly becoming the Collection's cash cow.</Description>

    <Description>Hyde is a small, almost entirely water covered world. It is lightly forested, and has thousands of small freshwater lakes. It is the site of a huge water purifactation plant, which has made the world a tempting target for Marik raiders over the years. &#xD; The city of Califar on Hyde is the headquarters of Zettle Metals Incorporated. One of the oldest mining and refining operations in the Lyran state, Zettle Metals was founded before the formation of the Lyran Commonwealth. Though its foundries on Hyde and Rahne suffered much during the Succession Wars, the company managed to survive, producing purified precious metals and industrial alloys for use in civilian, commercial and even military industries. &#xD; [3067] Recently, after Zettle prospectors reportedly discovered new veins of industrial-grade metals on the nearby planets of Arganda, Fianna and Sarpsbourg, the company opened negotiations with the governments of those worlds for permission to open new foundries. Such a discovery makes welcome news for the ancient mining company, as many planetologists believe the ready resources on Hyde and Rahne, though still ample, may burn out before Zettle can fulfill its obligations under a series of recent contracts to supply raw material to the factories on Hesperus II, Skye and Solaris VII.</Description>

    <Description>[3051] Khan Hoyt personally commanded the First Striker Cluster invading Hyner in November 3051. Dropping from heavy cloud cover, the Jaguar forces immediately engaged the Second Arkab Legion. The planet's defenders, fighting in Star League-era BattleMechs whose presence startled the Clans, gave the Jaguar forces a tough fight.&#xD; As the Clans slogged through Trent's Glen, the Legionnaires whittled them down using hit-and-run tactics. As the Clans cleared the glen, they turned and attacked the Second en masse. The Legion lines held initially, the buckled under the unrelenting fury of the Clan assault. More than half of the Legionnaires fled into the wooded glen in which they had recently fought, giving their Clan pursuers the slip and ultimately escaping the planet under the cover of darkness.&#xD; Warrington is the capital of Hyner, and served as the planetary command post for the Smoke Jaguar's during their occupation.&#xD; During the Star League era, the city of Quantico had been a thriving metropolis, and the second largest city on Hyner. A methane processing facility at a nearby swamp, provided a third of Hyner's entire power needs. Both the city and power plant were destroyed during the First Succession War, victims of a Lyran Commonwealth attack. The SLDF also maintained various facilities on Hyner prior to the fall of the Star League.&#xD; [3059] Like many other first-wave engagements during Operation Bulldog, the battle for Hyner was distinctly one-sided. The Second Sword of Light faced off against the Third Jaguar Cavaliers, with the First Regulan Hussars and the ninth Com Guard Division as support. As it turned out, the Second Sword did not need any help to completely crush the Jaguars.</Description>

    <Description>[3025] Prefect Stefan Shor of Trondheim is attempting to promote Idlewind as a center for trade with the Periphery. The Kuritan government is quite amenable to the idea, but most Periphery traders are still uncomfortable about entering Kurita space for extensive negotiations.&#xD; [3050] The Third Jaguar Cavaliers Assault Trinary, commanded by Star Colonel Paul Moon, dropped on to the lightly defended world of Idlewind in March 3050. Upon realizing that a single armored battalion of local militia stood ready to repel the invaders, Moon declared that the forces within his Assault Trinary would bid for the right to lead the rest in taking the world. The honor fell to two Points of Elementals, led by Star Commander Joal. The Star Commander issued a batchall to the defending militia, who agreed to meet the Elementals in a wooded area approximately two kilometer's from Idlewind's capital city. The Elementals dropped from their troop carrier straight into the woods; seconds later, dozens of napalm bombs planted by the militia exploded, setting off a raging inferno around them.&#xD; Unfortunately for the militia, the napalm tactic only enraged the Elementals. Their armored suits were impervious to the fire, and the two Points emerged from the death-trap unscathed. Star Commander Joal and his troops led the Third Cavaliers' Assault Trinary in search of the enemy. Reasoning that the militia had probably gone to ground into the nearby capital, the Star Commander declared it a no-holds-barred target. Any enemy dishonorable to set a trap for its foe deserved no mercy. The Trinary's 'Mechs and Elementals swept through the city in a street-by-street search, destroying buildings and even tearing up pavements in search of the "cowardly" militia who refused to stand and fight.&#xD; The city's inhabitants responded with defiance, taking up every weapon they could find to battle the invaders. Unfortunately for the people of Idlewind, shotguns and rifles and ancient troop carriers were no match for a Trinary of angry Clan Smoke Jaguar warriors. The Jaguars hunted down every defender they saw; within three hours, they had slaughtered half of the captial's inhabitants and reduced its buildings to rubble.&#xD; [3059] During Operation Bulldog, the entire Smoke Jaguar Fifth Garrison Cluster on Idlewind abandoned the world, after receiving the recall order on the 13th August 3059.</Description>

    <Description>[3039] Operation Orochi, Kanrei Theodore Kurita�s counter-assault during the War of 3039 began in July, forcing Hanse Davion to delay any further attacks whilst the incursion was dealt with. General Raul Coburn, commanding the First and Third Dismal Disinherited, received orders from New Avalon to �hold� on 25 July. By then, however, his mercenaries were already on Igualada and engaged with the planetary militia. Rather than put the operation, and his men, in jeopardy � and give the militia the chance to regroup and call in reinforcements � General Coburn continued on with the invasion operations, quickly crushing the five light battalions of militia the people of Igualada could muster. &#xD; After less than a week of fighting, Coburn declared victory on the world in a dispatch to New Avalon and began preparing the world for an occupation force. Just a few weeks later, however, Coburn received a message from New Avalon, this one ordering the Disinheriteds off of Igualada and back to Cassias. Coburn replied, emphasizing his mercenaries could hold the world indefinitely or could even continue on to Matsuida to relieve pressure on other Galedon Thrust worlds, but when the Faxed reply came back some nine days later, he was told in no uncertain terms to evacuate the world and return to the Federated Suns. &#xD; The Disinheriteds returned through the Huan system, relieving their Second regiment from a heavy DCMS counter-assault. That move garnered Coburn a reprimand from New Avalon, though once he learned the entire story, Field Marshal Sortek had that reprimand removed, instead complimenting the entire unit for their service to the Federated Suns and later arranging personal meetings with Prince Davion and Field Marshal Sandoval to smooth the incident over.</Description>

    <Description>The center of the Illyrian Palatinate, Illyria supports a small shipbuilding center on its southern continent. Colonized by enterprising businessmen in the Twenty-Forth century, the population of mainly Scandinavian ancestry prospered through modest trade with the Free Worlds League. Since the beginning of the Succession Wars, the Palatinate has sponsored annual MechWarrior games, in which the combatants duel to the death for salvage and spare parts, as a secondary source of revenue.&#xD; There is evidence that Illyria may once have hosted a Star League 'Mech repair facility. To date, some modest amounts of equipment have been recovered, though reports of stashes of serviceable BattleMechs along the northern territories remain unsupported, however.&#xD; Ruled by an Oligarchy of rich trading families, Palatinate citizens lived a relatively tranquil existence until the 3030's, when leaders of the nearby Circinus Federation began to make belligerent noises about conquering the small realm. The Circinians attempted to annex the Palatinate in 3034, but ran into unexpected military opposition and were quickly routed from the realm.&#xD; Trouble from an unexpected source occurred midway through the thirty-first century - a vast influx of refugee's fleeing from the Clan invasion. Between 3049 to 3052, the Palatinate became the favored destination of thousands of Rasalhagian refugees. Drawn to the Palatinate as much by its predominately Scandinavian culture as it prosperity, the refugees arrived in droves. This sudden population increase nearly overwhelmed the tiny Palatinate; housing and food shortages became commonplace even among Illyrian natives. Only by increasing its trade shipments to the FWL and with refugee aid grants from the Federated Commonwealth and Draconis Combine, have the Palatinate's economic and social problems begun to be solved.</Description>

    <Description>Imbros III was a part of the Terran Hegemony when Stefan Amaris usurped the Star League throne and sounded the death knell of humanity's Golden Age. An unremarkable, water-poor world of rocky mountains and bone-dry canyons, with little mineral wealth save a few veins of precious metals and an abundance of bauxite, Imbros sparked little to no interest for the Usurper. Instead, he forced House Kurita, using hostages of the Draconis Combine's ruling line as leverage, to garrison this planet in advance of Kerensky's return. These same Combine forces gave way easily to the liberating SLDF, only to return in force after the League's collapse just a few years later. &#xD; Though never a valuable military or industrial prize, Imbros III did provide strategic value to the Combine as a border world to the Lyran Commonwealth, so the centuries of warfare that followed the fall of the League saw many raids and campaigns either launched against this planet or staged from it. The Federated Commonwealth finally captured Imbros III during the Fourth Succession War, as part of the so-called Lyons Thumb, only to lose it again at the onset of the FedCom Civil War.&#xD; Trunner, the largest city and planetary capital, sits on the banks of the Youli River on the southern continent of Opilacca. Southeast of Opilacca lie the large twin continents of Barnar and Martego. On Martego, between the Maulan and Wanalahi Rivers, lies the major spaceport city of Larabel. Small towns-most interconnected by a series of winding monorailways that cross expanses of alternating woods and deserts - dot the continents of Opilacca, Barnar, and Martego. Imbros III's fourth continent, the glacial south polar continent of Fryggia, is totally uninhabited.</Description>

    <Description>Discovered in the late twenty-forth century, Inarcs was designated a very desirable world for colonization. Due to a computer filing mistake, it was classified as marginal by the Star League. When the League began looking for a world to be used as a prison, Inarcs met the requirements they needed. Soon nearly 100,000 criminal, malcontents and political prisoners were exiled to Inarcs for their crimes.&#xD; Twenty years later, the Star League returned to find a vibrant and flourishing community. Stunned beyond belief, officials soon realized that their information had been mistaken. Even with only one very large landmass, the continent of Insel Desteufels (Devil�s Island), named after the infamous prison island on Terra, the people had thrived. The continent was a virtual paradise, and they named their capital Utopia.&#xD; Inarcs had many island chains that would be exploited for their mineral resources. Huge iron-ore and precious metals were discovered in the Vespia Mountain ranges. The Star League pardoned the colonists and allowed industries to come to the planet. Blackstone Industries was first to set up mining operations, shipping refined metal to its other BattleMech plants, though dozens of others rushed to follow suit decades later. Today, Inarcs is an important cog in the Alliance military machine, providing BattleMechs as much as other war-fighting material to the LAAF.&#xD; [3059] The Blackstone Highlanders mercenary unit was originally created more than 75 years ago to defend the Blackstone family's industrial holdings on Inarcs. The command's main financial support still comes from Blackstone Industries, and the unit often serves as the company's garrison force on Inarcs, which is effectively their homeworld. Additionally, the Highlanders act as field testers for the 'Mechs manufactured at Blackstone BattleMechs, which opened in 3053.&#xD; The Highlanders work for outside clients as well. The unit has a long-standing contract for pirate hunting in the Coventry Province, and recently the Highlanders completed at two-year contract with ComStar's Explorer Corps, helping to map the anti-spinward deep Periphery.&#xD; The Blackstone family has dominated the industrial landscape of Inarcs ever since the planet's accidental founding as a Star League-era penal colony ages ago. Over time, the family's wealth and influence became so great that they forged their own corporate security force and mercenary command, dubbed the Blackstone Highlanders, primarily to secure their interests at home and abroad.&#xD; In 3053, under a license with the Federated Commonwealth government, the Blackstones graduated to BattleMech production when they upgraded their Erewhon factories to produce the Star League- designed Enfield medium BattleMech. Just three years later, as the first run of the new 'Mechs had finally begun to roll off the assembly lines for assignment to FedCom border troops, Blackstone won a second government contract to produce the Talon, a light 'Mech not seen since the last Star League-era facility producing them was annihilated in the mid-2800s. &#xD; Though such strokes of luck made the Blackstones a household name almost overnight, the demand for both of the company's designs remains far greater than the actual output. Blackstone BattleMechs is years behind on orders to the Lyran Alliance and the Federated Suns governments, and new plant expansions are expected soon to alleviate the strain.</Description>

Not surprisingly, many Capellan nobles reside year-round on Ingersoll, leaving the mundane administration of their holdings in the hands of less-fortunate stewards.  To guard this luxurious world, Ingersoll has a reserve regiment and a large AeroSpace training center near the equator. &#xD; [2415] The massive loss of civilian life in the Tintavel system in 2412 prompted Chancellor Aleisha Liao to convene a conference of delegates from the major ruling houses, including the new Terran Hegemony. Situated on the Capellan world of Ares, the conference was to discuss ways of limiting the destructiveness of modern warfare in general and the loss of civilian life in particular. The unexpected result of the extraordinary summit meeting, brought about and later held together by the tireless efforts of Aleisha Liao, was the drafting of the Ares Conventions.&#xD; Aleisha Liao died of natural causes on December 20, 2415. Her state funeral on Ingersoll attracted over three million visitors (more than the native population at that time).&#xD; [3025] Ingersoll is the site of one of the 16 Philotechnique Institutes. These serve the Capellan state as special post-secondary institutions. Established originally in the mid-28th century as technical and scientific training centers, the institutes today also emphasize "philosophical" (political) training. Admission to a Philotechnique Institute is by special recommendation of a planetary director only, and all expenses are paid by the state. Often enough, students in these institutions have previously served with distinction as members of the Ranks of the Dedicated.

    <Description>Located just coreward of the Marik Commonwealth, Irian is best known for its vast BattleMech manufacturing centers. This heavily garrisoned world has been invaded only once, by the Lyran Commonwealth in 2842, and the factories were left undamaged in the subsequent fighting.&#xD; A survey taken in 3025 indicates that, of all the worlds in the Free Worlds League, the people of Irian spend more time per capita watching videos than any other. The reason for this is unknown; neither the quality of the technology or the variety of programming is any better here than elsewhere in the League. Perhaps it has something to do with Irian's seasonal changes, which make people sluggish in the summer and restless in the winter, or perhaps there is something narcotic in the environment.&#xD; The Irian landscape offers little of interest to either tourists or developers. Inedible grass covers most of the hilly or mountainous land, and the flatlands consist mostly of deserts with few minerals of any value. The oceans and rivers yield little in the way of seafood. Despite the fact that the people of Irian have to import most of their food (or perhaps because of it), Irian cuisine is notoriously bland.&#xD; The Irian 'Mech factory is situated in the base of Soapstone Mountain, a location similar to the much larger Hesperus II facilities in the Federated Commonwealth. This attempt at fortification has not prevented its near destruction in the past, most recently at the hands of Anton Marik's rebels in 3014.</Description>

    <Description>Irurzun is an important world for the Draconis Combine.  Recent discoveries of radioactive elements, gemstones, and metal ores have increased the necessity of keeping the Federated Suns away from the planet.  To this end, two complete 'Mech regiments, the 3rd and 6th Benjamin Regulars, plus three infantry regiments, are headquartered on the planet.  Though many of the units are spread out to worlds closer to the border, the number of soldiers on Irurzun makes it a crowded world for its size.  Most of the activity centers are in New Gotham City on the continent of South Umbrian, as this is the capital of the planet and of the prefecture.  Away from the cities, Irurzun shows a more pastoral side.  There are many small famres raising marshy plant crops in the hot and humid atmosphere.  With the discovery of so many hidden resources in recent years, it is unlikely that Irurzun's picturesque areas will remain intact much longer.  Already a crew from New Samarkand Metals has arrived to begin a huge strip mining operation.  Agents of the ISF have also been interested in Irurzun in recent months.  Rumor has it that operatives from the Federated Suns may also be present on the planet.  If this is true, the metsukes must hunt them down.  The DCMS High Command suspects that if Davion agents are on the planet, it may mean that Irurzun will be the focus of some military effort in the near future.</Description>

With a population of close to 90000, this warm temperate world has become a key producer of native minerals and wines as well. Because the Taurians recognize the significance of this world's natural beauty, they have taken the unprecedented step of demilitarizing Ishtar in the hopes of reducing the likelihood of enemy attack. In addition to being the principal Taurian agricultural world, it is also distinguished as the only undefended planet in the Concordat sphere of influence. The Taurians are so determined to preserve the "neutrality" of this idyllic world that they have also barred ComStar representatives admittance to the planet for fear that the presence of ComStar technology will invite unwarranted aggression by deep-space raiders.</Description>

    <Description>[3025] On Islamabad, the Azami are in direct conflict with the smaller Sunni Moslem population. The feud between the two has roots extending back at least a millennium. The two religious groups have carried out a guerrilla war on the planet's desert continent for the past 50 years, despite the heavy Davion presence garrisoned there to stop it. Recent discoveries of oil and radioactives on the planet have suddenly given new urgency to the religious feud.&#xD; First unveiled in 3030, the Com Guard's primary mission was to protect a world's HPG transmitter, though Primus Waterly assured the Inner sphere leaders that these forces would be "as inoffensive and helpful as possible to the surrounding populations." Stories of their good deeds quickly began to flood the popular media.&#xD; One such deed occurred on Islamabad, when the religious hatred exploded into a series of riots that rocked the planet. Com Guard forces accepted the pleas for help from the planetary governor and began to police the worst-hit sections of cities while mediating the dispute.&#xD; [3062] One of the oldest units in the AFFC, the Islamabad CMM began life as the Messengers of Shiva, the combat arm of the United Hindu Collective (UHC). When the collective joined the Federated Suns in 2540, the Messengers were absorbed into the AFFS. Their traditions have eroded, but the thirty-first century has seen a rise in nationalism in the semi-independent collective, which has in turn prompted similar changes in the CMM. Chief among these is a resurgence in caste-based politics that threatens to undermine the unit's organization.</Description>

    <Description>Izar's parent star is actually part of a binary system that consists of a cool, orange K0 sun orbiting a blue-white B5 subgiant. Because of the substantial distance between the two stars, planets were miraculously able to form close to both stars, but only the closest world of the smaller star had developed a breathable atmosphere and enough surface water to support life when it was discovered early in man's journey into space. &#xD; However, Izar's orbit, roughly half again as far from its parent star as Terra is from Sol, rendered it a cool world. In fact, with clouds and storms common -even over the interior of the larger landmasses of Celta, Eddin, Morope and Trantara - nights on Izar were particularly cold. Though this did not faze the native evergreen woods that covered most of the hilly mainlands, colonists quickly learned that the only way to make use of the world's fertile soil for their own crops was to encapsulate their farms beneath environmentally sealed domes.&#xD; Izar also boasted substantial natural resources, including rare earths and industrial-grade metals capable of supporting a robust manufacturing industry, and the early settlers quickly attained a level of self-sufficiency with minimal off-world support. Thus it came as little surprise on Terra when this world declared its independence during the Outer Reaches Rebellion, or that the Terran Alliance sent a doomed expedition to reclaim it in 2236.&#xD; After an unopposed landing, the Terran troops found the capital deserted. Despite this unchallenged occupation, Terran squads sent to scout the thickly forested hills around the city invariably failed to return. Though the Izarians were armed only primitively, they had expert knowledge of the local terrain. The Terrans, unable to move their cumbersome high-tech weapons through the woods, remained at a serious disadvantage throughout the conflict.&#xD; As much as the rebels in the hills, the women of Izar did their part as well. Posing as pretty, dumb locals, they often showed themselves more than willing to entertain a homesick soldier on a cold night. Such men frequently ended up with a knife in the belly, or scratches from sharp fingernails tinged with an alkolyde nail polish that brought agonizing death within minutes. Despite a few women being shot when they could be proved guilty - and even when not - this didn't change anything. The Terrans kept losing troops to the nightstalkers as the nights on Izar were cold. &#xD; Apart from the planetary capital of Promise Point, Izar boasts a second major spaceport in the city of Rhyss on the southern Trantara continent.</Description>

The Canopian commander called on the Capellans to surrender on several occasions, but they refused to do so and had to be hunted down one by one. The Lancers took few casualties, but the coursing of the militia left an indelible mark on their psyche; if planetary militia fought so hard, what would a line unit do, let alone a Warrior House?&#xD; [3033] When the Capellan counter-attack against Jacomarie came in April 3030, the combined assault by Ishara�s Grenadiers and House Dai Da Chi was brutally efficient; the Grenadiers pinned Long�s Light Lancers in place while the Warrior House flanked them, launching vicious attacks on the weakest part of the MAF line.&#xD; The morale of the Lancers, already low after the failure on Turin in April 3032, collapsed, and the regiment withdrew in disarray, the CCAF picking off stray lances and even companies with relative ease. Only a valiant last-ditch effort by the Lancer rearguard allowed them to escape. In only eleven days of fighting the Periphery troops were ejected, but the Capellans� blood lust was not sated, and House Dai Da Chi boarded their transports for their next target.</Description>

    <Description>Jaipur is a small planet with modest resources and a reasonably pleasant atmosphere, located in the Capellan March.&#xD; The original settlers of Jaipur were from Terran India and from the planet Mars. They settled down to begin farming the dry, but workable land. When the planet became the site of a major battle in 2533, during the Civil War era of the Federated Suns, the farmers waited quietly until the killing stopped and they could return to their land once more.&#xD; Cassandra Varney's forces had managed to isolate General Gordon, Prince Alexander Davion's most loyal commander, and his small force by keeping them under siege on Jaipur. Alexander Davion launched a hasty attack to relieve pressure on his general, but being forced to rely on second-rate troops, the rescue attempt unsurprisingly failed and Gordon was forced to surrender his troops. When brought for trial for "war crimes" by Cassandra Varney, the young General was condemned to death and executed. Most of his troops were similarly slaughtered.&#xD;  For several hundred years, the predominantly agricultural population was contented enough. They did fairly well during the Star League Era, but only barely survived the First and Second Succession Wars. Now that the progress of the Third War has pushed the Capellan border far from Jaipur, the planetary population looks forward to years of peace.&#xD; Things began to change recently when the Feruc family decided to become one of the industrial powers of the Federated Suns. They have begun to mine the planet's meager resources and to build huge factories far beyond the capacity of the planet or its people. This has led to growing resentment among the common folk and some of Jaipur's lesser nobles.&#xD;  The capital of Jaipur is New Amritsar.</Description>

The Tribe took what they needed before moving on, this time thwarting efforts to stop them when a large group of their AeroSpace Fighters intercepted and kept two battalions of Kurita 'Mechs out of the battle.&#xD; [3050] When Clan Ghost Bear Khan Theresa DelVillar announced her batchall for Jarett in May 3050, Tai-sa Sonia Zev of the Ninth Alshain Regulars did not understand what response the Ghost Bear Khan expected to receive. She did know that she had an inexperienced unit under her command, and she had no intention of revealing here troops' lack of experience to the Clan. Unfortunately for Zev, Khan DelVillar had already learned from ComStar officials that the green Ninth regiment was spread out in three battalions over the northern part of the planet.&#xD; Khan DelVillar dropped her units in a standard combat formation and immediately faced the determined warriors of the Ninth. The battle began with Khan DelVillar challenging a Commando. The Khan's Elemental Point quickly shredded the Commando, but the 'Mechs pilot refused to give up, continuing to fight even against the Clan's massive battle-armored troopers. The Khan captured this feisty young warrior and made him her bondsman - the rest of the Ghost Bear warriors followed her lead by attempting to capture their opponents rather than kill them. This made the survival rate of the Ninth impressively high.&#xD; The main battle for Jarett was fought in the lush foliage of the Solun Jungle. The Ninth's lead battalion made excellent use of the cover allowed by the trees, a lesson that Kanrei Kurita would borrow for himself later in the invasion. For nearly a week the Ninth survived by fighting on the run, but the Ghost Bears followed this fox hunt to its inevitable conclusion - the Ninth eventually succumbed to Clan Ghost Bear nearly ten days after the Golden Bears landed, but not before the defenders were able to gut the Gorton, Kingsley &amp; Thorpe Enterprises 'Mech plant.</Description>

The industrial cities of the southern continent welcomed membership of a larger, more powerful nation, and abundant fossil fuels made plundering the northern forest uneconomical.

The size of the new strike and the comparative ease of traveling to the planet caused the mining industry of Jesup to collapse. Acting purely from business  considerations, the Black Ball Trading Company cut its losses and stopped service to Jesup. Mining was the planet's only industry and the freighters of the Black Ball Line were its only source of food. Thousands died on Jesup before anyone noticed.&#xD; The Jesup Incident, as it came to be known, sparked a storm of protest. Most of the public's wrath was aimed at the Black Ball Trading Company for pulling out of Jesup despite being the planet's lifeline. Prince Ian Davion issued the Jesup Trade Regulations in 3013, severely restricting all trade and freighter services from making major changes in their routes. After the Black Ball Trading Company was forced into bankruptcy, it was bought out by White Swan Trans-Stellar, Inc. Its current operating name is Jesup Traders.

The Brigades attempted to outmaneuver the Bears, but the Clan forces moved too swiftly for them. &#xD; The Brigades scrambled to the Pleasure Grotto, where they had set up remote-firing weapons and vibrabombs. The pursuing Bears easily side-stepped most of these, but found it more difficult than they expected to rout the defenders. They finally resorted to aerial bombardment, forcing both defending units into the open where the Ghost Bear 'Mechs dispatched them.&#xD; [3062] At the start of the Ghost Bear War, the DCMS became desperate for any sort of victory to boost sagging morale. Eager to provide such a boost, the Black Thorns mercenary company jumped into Jezersko and proceeded to wage a guerrilla war campaign over a period of several months.&#xD; After fending off raids on several supply depots, the Twenty-Ninth PGC wised up and set a trap. Hiding a Trinary of �mechs inside an empty depot, they leaked out intelligence suggesting that their forces were spread thin, and that the depot was lightly defended.&#xD; Rianna Rose, the units XO, led half the Thorn�s to the site but when the ambush was sprung, an unlucky shot left her critically wounded. Jeremiah led an attempt to extract her, but the Ghost Bears would not relent. It was not until a recent recruit, Sgt.

Mostly out of the public spotlight Valiant also produced military-grade armor and missile systems for the AFFS. In the waning years of the Third Succession War, though, the company partnered with Wunderland Enterprises to design and build the Striker Light Tank, a cheap but effective wheeled vehicle that gained popularity in the AFFS. &#xD; Producing that vehicle in the new Johnsondale plant constructed in 3006, the company soon began to build a number of different light combat vehicles for both the AFFS and local militia forces. Still, it wasn�t until after the Clan&#xD;Invasion that Valiant and Wunderland jointly debuted a new combat design, the Pilum Heavy Tank. At about the same time, however, both companies provided significant aid to the Combine�s Scarborough Manufacturers on Al Na�ir. Though that aid garnered both significant animosity within the Draconis March, it ultimately provided Valiant the opportunity to build the Pegasus Hovertank, which the AFFS has been snapping up as fast as they can be produced.</Description>

    <Description>[3052] Star Colonel Istal Develis won honor for her assault on Juazeiro by fighting a tight, intelligent campaign that allowed her forces to the the world with minimal losses in January 3052. Her first move was to send a Headhunter Star to compromise the defending Twenty-First Galedon regulars command position. Concerned with accuracy placing his troops in hidden positions, Tai-sa Adam Sawyer was taken completely by surprise when Elementals destroyed his headquarters. Adam's brother Lee assumed command of the regiment upon the commander's death, and attempted to fight from the positions established in the original battle plan.&#xD; The Twenty-First only realized the Nova Cats' frontal assault was a feint when the Forty-Forth Nova Cat Cavaliers attacked from the rear. Sawyer quickly broke his troops into lances and initiated a campaign of hit-and-run skirmishes that he hoped would allow the Twenty-First's surviving elements to reach its landing zone and leave the planet.&#xD; Less than a battalion of the Twenty-First escaped offworld, and Devalis's insignificant losses gave her a victory. Hindsight showed that, had Star Colonel Devalis included aerospace assets in her bid to take the planet, she would have destroyed the entire Regulars force.&#xD; [3059] A simulator fight between the Command Company Binary of the Sixth Nova Cat Regulars and the Command Company of the Izanagi Warriors, decided the fate of Juazeiro during the second wave of Operation Bulldog. The battle ended quickly when Tai-sa Shin Yodama in his Dragonfire, decapitated Star Colonel Bil Leroux's Hellbringer with a well-placed autocannon shot.</Description>

The OmniMechs of Alpha and Bravo Stars of the Second Assault Trinary, 214th Jaguar Dragoons, defeated the Kabah Guards in a single hour-long battle on the jousting fields of Kabah Palace. Only three of the Guards survived to become bondsmen.&#xD; [3059] During the Forth and final wave of Operation Bulldog, the Smoke Jaguar defenders on most of their remaining OZ worlds only fought long enough to satisfy their honor. The Seventh Garrison Cluster left behind to defend Kabah held out much longer before agreeing to Trails of Possession. Staging several delaying actions, the garrison troops hoped to hold out until ships from Matamoras to pull them off-world. Only when the Twenty-Second Dieron Regulars finally convinced the Cluster commander that no escape was forthcoming did the Cluster initiate Trials of Possession. These challenges were split evenly between the Regulars and the supporting Nova Cat Lancers.</Description>

When the Bears arrived in-system, the Kaesong government pleaded with the mercenaries to defend their planet, but the mercenaries' agreement did more harm than good. &#xD; Knowing that his troops would face dezgra mercenaries, Star Colonel Dane Jorgensson skipped the bidding process and simply sent in the elite Trinary Command, 14th Battle Cluster, to deal with the Lightning. Outgunned and outnumbered, the mercenaries retreated into the streets of Vedsan City, where the Ghost Bears rooted them out and destroyed them.</Description>

    <Description>The capital city of Kagoshima is Kuroda.&#xD; [3059] Located on Kagoshima, the Wisdom of the Dragon (WD) is one of the few "finishing" universities in the Draconis Combine. Cadets who have already completed two to four years of training in a military academy may attend the university to hone their skills in strategy and command. Like the Sun Zhang MechWarrior Academy, the WD turns out warriors who are considered the elite of the DCMS.&#xD; Though the Wisdom of the Dragon university is officially open to all Combine citizens who meet its physical and mental entry requirements, only officer candidates attend this university, and most of these are fresh from another academy, are have already spent several years in the ranks of the DCMS. In addition, an applicant must have the highest marks from his or her academy class or be sponsored by a DCMS field officer of Tai-sa rank or higher.&#xD; WD specializes in teaching leadership, tactics and strategy. Beyond those subjects, cadets are encouraged to choose elective training in a variety of skills that support their chosen specialty. WD devotes most of its resources to MechWarriors, but in recent years has expanded its courses for cavalry and infantry fields, as well as the newly developed battlesuit field.&#xD; The atmosphere at Wisdom of the Dragon has an intensity unmatched in other Combine academies and universities, including Sun Zhang. No matter what the field, a cadet's course of study pushes the cadet to the limits of his or her physical and mental endurance. In addition, cadets must cope with the intense social pressure to follow the ancient traditions on which the Draconis Combine was founded. The university's rigorous adherence to the precepts of bushido exceeds that of any other university, and instructors stress loyalty to House Kurita above all. Theodore Kurita's reforms have met fierce resistance from the university's instructors, who routinely penalize students for using tactics they consider improper. But despite the die-hards, university policy is slowly changing to conform with the Coordinator's wishes.&#xD; The graduation ceremony is a grand affair, and takes place in the Coordinator's presence; The Coordinator himself awards each graduate the coveted katana and wakizashi. Graduates are expected to serve the DCMS with honor and bravery and follow the tenets of bushido at all times.</Description>

    <Description>Kaifeng is a sparsely populated agricultural world. Approximately 60% of Kaifeng's total landmass is covered by dense jungle, but the remaining land contains some of the most productive agricultural concerns in the entire Inner Sphere. At four million tonnes per year, rice is Kaifeng's primary export. In fact, Kaifeng supplies almost all of Sarna's food and exports agricultural products to other nearby worlds as well.&#xD; Apart from the farming communities, Kaifeng has only four cities. The farmland is clumped into three large districts, one in the southern hemisphere and two in the northern. Each district is administered by a single large city - Franklin in the south, Beijing and Tarrahause in the north. The planets largest city and capital, Mahabodhi, is situated outside the Beijing District, and has the only full-service spaceport on the planet. The three districts act as gathering points - surplus food is routed from them to Mahabohdi for export. &#xD; Kaifeng has only one moon, Nochon, which is barely bigger than a mere asteroid.&#xD; With the signing of the Star League Accords in 2569, the Terran Hegemony, and Terra in particular, became an important center of activity. Naturally, the Court of the Star League in Unity City was the prime focus.&#xD; To show the united nature of the League, the interior of the court was built with materials from every corner of human space. From Kaifeng, came the huge pillars of Shimmer Granite that stood in the court's Grand Hall.</Description>

With the planet Benjamin close by, quite a few of the duties that would normally fall to Kajikazawa go instead to Benjamin.  This has left Kajikazawa less populated and less hectic than usual for a prefecture capital, which suits the population, fine.  Only the presence of the 2nd Benjamin Regulars reminds them that they are, indeed, an important part of the Draconis Combine.  The planet's major continent has large areas of mild climate and pleasant landscapes.  The government capitalizes on this with a major tourist industry and by renting out vacation mansions to the harried politicians of nearby Benjamin.  The planet also has several large ukiyos that cater to the upper classes.</Description>

    <Description>The wealthy world of Kalidasa, an independent duchy a single jump away from the Marik/Steiner border, still possesses some functioning 'Mech production facilities. The planet's climate is hot, with a thin atmosphere, high winds, and searing sandstorms that make it quite inhospitable (and historically difficult to seize). &#xD; [3025] Kalidasa is one of the major ports of entry for traders entering League space along the Lyran border. The starport cities on this world contain magnificent bazaars, teeming with merchant houses, wholesalers, and speculators who can find a profitable market (legal or otherwise) for virtually any commodity.&#xD; Both the Free Worlds League and Lyran Commonwealth government require that all traders entering and leaving their realms submit to a vessel search. Though many agencies of the Marik government (including spaceport civilian security forces, planetary garrison personnel, and Ministry of Inspection tariff inspectors) have the authority to inspect incoming and departing vessels, such inspections are usually carried out rather perfunctorily.&#xD; [3054] The FWL's lack of armor production facilities has led them to welcome with open arms even the dubious manufacturing process of the Quikscell Company.&#xD; [3067] One of the Free Worlds� most significant manufacturers, tied with Irian as the second largest after Earthwerks-FWL, Kali-Yama Weapons Industries Inc. has benefited greatly from mass exports to other Inner Sphere powers. Though such exports offer a lower profit margin than domestic sales because of border tariffs, they have nonetheless netted the company considerable sums of cash and credit, much of which Kali-Yama has invested in modernizing and upgrading factories and the development of new technologies. The company�s scientists worked closely with the LCCC on the development of OmniMechs, most notably the Perseus, of which Kali-Yama remains the sole manufacturer at its Westport plant on Kalidasa. The company also pioneered the development of missile and ballistic weapon technologies used to upgrade classic �Mech designs like the Hunchback, Trebuchet and Orion.&#xD; The past few years have seen CEO Ryce-O�Neil locked in protracted negotiations with Kali-Yama�s business partners, the Alphard Trading Corporation. The Taurian corporation is a minority shareholder in the Kendall plant, and Ryce-O�Neil has worked to either secure sole ownership of the plant or purchase the partner company outright and make it a subsidiary. The Alphard board seems open to the possibilities, but the CEO�s efforts have been hampered by the Taurian government, especially given the problems currently wracking the Concordat. Security concerns have curtailed Kali-Yama trips to Perdition, and Ryce-O�Neil has vented her frustration through a series of political maneuvers on Kalidasa�s unofficial Merchants� Council.&#xD; The main targets of these operations are her business competitors in Quikscell. This rivalry has raged between the two companies for decades, but Baroness Hestor Hepburn-Marik has used her influence with local FWLM forces to keep the peace. Kali-Yama�s own security force � including a battalion of �Mechs, officially for demonstration purposes � guards the Kalidasa facility against foreign aggression. The Kendall plant is less well protected, fielding only a company of �Mechs, but the �Mech company is augmented with a substantial infantry force, including battle armor.</Description>

    <Description>In contrast to the other "Peoples of the Book," the Moslem community has retained little influence in the Free Worlds League. The Islamic faith is very constraining and not at all in harmony with the entrepreneurial nature of the Free Worlds. In particular, the payment of zakat (alms) and the sexist attitude of some Islamic sects are disharmonious with the Free Worlds' temperament.&#xD; One of the most popular sects is the doctrine of K'Wara, founded by an Islamic mullah on Kanata during the middle of the 25th century. This is representative of the conservative offshoots of the Moslem faith. It is extremely anti-technological, almost Luddite in its outlook, and is presently one of the most virulent anti-bionic groups.</Description>

The Freemen put the lessons they had learned so painfully on Rasalhague to good use on Kandis. They, along with most of the Kandis militia, scattered themselves throughout the main continent of Cess, determined to hit and run from the invaders.&#xD; This plan worked for several days, but when Khan Garth Radick finally recognized this strategy he ordered his forces to hit the defenders' communication and command structures. Of key importance to the Khan's plan was the death or capture of General Major Rhodes, the charismatic commander of the defending forces. The Wolf forces, comprised of Trinaries Command and Assault and Binary Elemental (of the 352nd Assault Cluster), along with the Silver Keshik, captured the general at his headquarters with a series of lightning raids, and resistance collapsed soon afterwards.&#xD; The capital of Kandis is Coalston City.</Description>

    <Description>[3050] Aware that his troops would face the green Eleventh Alshain Regulars and the more experienced Thirty-Forth Galedon Regulars, saKhan Carns chose to split his invading force and attack the defending units simultaneously in March 3052. The Eleventh had taken a position on a high bluff that fell steeply away to a grassy plain, planning to take full advantage of this natural fortification's steep rise and crumbling limestone cliff face.&#xD; Unable to precisely determine why the planet's defenders made this choice but confident that their superior weaponry and armor would carry the day, saKhan Carns landed the First Nova Cat Guards on the plains below the Eleventh's position. While this position did not prove particularly damaging, saKhan Carns found his unit's inability to reach the Kurita troops from below, even by using the unique skills of the Elementals, extremely frustrating. Adding to his frustration, it quickly became apparent that the Eleventh's main goal was simply to occupy the invaders until the Thirty-Forth arrived to reinforce them.&#xD; The second Clan force, made up of the 449th and 489th Assault Clusters, attacked the Thirty-Forth in the interlocking tunnels and caverns of a natural formation known as Theodore's Retreat. Using well-placed traps and plenty of ammunition, Tai-sa Venn Oblak and his troops managed to seriously damage the attackers. Star colonel Evelyn Morris eventually ordered a fighting retreat from what appeared to be a death-trap, her troops seeding the tunnels and caverns with explosives as the withdrew. Less than half the Thirty-Forth walked away from the collapsed landmark. &#xD; Upon discovering that the 449th had accomplished its goal, saKhan Carns ordered the unit to board its DropShips and land behind the Eleventh's lines. Unable to hold its position in the face of this new enemy force, the green Eleventh broke and ran, somehow managing to escape the planet with a substantial number of its members intact.&#xD; [3059] Though limited in scale, the formal contest against the Nova Cats on Kanowit was one of the most violent engagements between the DCMS and Nova Cat forces. Kanowit was a front-line world, and Nova Cat honor demanded a true battle. Only by defeating them would the invading forces prove worthy of their respect and support.&#xD; The Ninth Nova Cat Regulars, under the command of Star Colonel Henderson, faced the First Proserpina Hussars. Led by Tai-sa Alexander Minowa - holder of the Katana Cluster for his impressive tally of OmniMech kills - the Hussars were up to the task. Following the battle, the Ninth became part of the SLDF Nova Cats.</Description>

    <Description>During the latter half of the 24th century, the frozen wasteland of Kansu was finally colonized. The planet's continents were covered with vast fields of blue-grey foliage. These plants were volatile when exposed to high heat, a side effect of storing energy as methane rather than fat. &#xD; Colonists learned this by accident when they tried using the plants in their hearths after drying them out, a process that made them more volatile. Many early colonists lost limbs clearing the land. The colonists learned to carefully and remotely harvest the ice plants as a renewable energy source. Similar metabolisms in the plant and microbial organisms of Kansu's ice-shrouded oceans left its sea floor covered in methane-hydrate ices.&#xD; Kansu is a rather small world with three continents. Kantuene is the largest continent, located at the equator and extending into the northern and southern hemispheres. The majority of the population lives in the capital, Raijianstad, the largest of Kansu's domed cities, built in and around a large crevasse. It was underground that the settlers discovered rich fields of radioactive and precious metals. The continents of Matawan and Fetid remained largely unpopulated. Matawan is where the radioactive ores were refined. Fetid was turned over to the Federated Suns military, which built a base there after the Fourth Succession War.</Description>

    <Description>Kathil was once considered a small, unremarkable world near the Capellan border. It's blue-green waters frame yellow-green continents, the washed out vegetation a result of the Chlorophyll-poor plant life that is used to the system's bright F-class star. Muran is the largest continent. Mountainous, it's western shore is almost continually swathed in clouds, drowning it in rain, while the interior remains an arid plain running all the way to the temperate and moderate eastern seaboard. The island continent of Thespia contains numerous deserts. The few deposits of rare metals were not enough to attract more than a trickle of colonists, most of whom had to turn to farming to survive. With the formation of the Star League and the struggle of the Reunification War, Kathil's importance soared. &#xD; The war fought to bring the distant Periphery states into the Star League put a heavy strain on the JumpShips and DropShips of the Star League Navy. The vast distances those ships had to travel for repairs often all the way to Terra might keep them out of the fighting for years. For this reason, the Star League decided to build major shipyards outside the Terran member state in 2596. Among the planets chosen as sites for Star League Naval Repair and Refit Facilities was Kathil. It was chosen over others nearby because its star system is free of asteroids and dust that might easily damage the delicate JumpShips. It also has a remarkably stable sun with few solar flares or storms. The facilities were officially christened the James McKenna Shipyards in 2602.&#xD; The facility is actually composed of two separate shipyards. One was a huge complex of repair docks and machine shops for JumpShips orbiting near the Zenith jumppoint. The other was a series of orbiting repair bays for DropShips. On the planet itself was a complex of repair industries and parts warehouses. Throughout the Star League era, the McKenna Shipyards serviced ships of the Star League Navy as well as from private navies of the Capellan Confederation, the Federated Suns, and civilian trading companies.&#xD; Like so much else, that all ended with the collapse of the Star League. Capellan Warships made their way to Kathil, and despite heavy resistance from Federated Suns Warships, they managed to cripple the JumpShip yards. Several subsequent attacks aimed at both shipyards have further reduced their functioning. Though the JumpShip yards have been repaired enough to do routine ship maintenance and to perform a few major overhauls, so much was damaged and so much has been forgotten that most of the shipyard stands empty and unused. The DropShip yards are in much better condition and remain as the largest and best-kept DropShip repair facility in the Federated Suns.&#xD; Several raids by Capellan 'Mechs have destroyed most of the on-world warehouse and parts factories. Almost all of the JumpShip parts have been destroyed or carried off. Quite a few parts for DropShips still exist, but the drastic loss of technology has left the use of some of these parts nothing short of a mystery.&#xD; The capital of Kathil is District City.&#xD; [3025] With its headquarters based in Kathil's capital, General Motors is a major manufacturer of motors and wheeled vehicles. Much of the company's business is with the Davion military, and so the factories on Kathil have been the target of numerous attacks from the Capellan Confederation. The company has managed to survive, however, and with the aid of its new factories on Salem and Talcott, it looks forward to continuing its growth. GM of Kathil also manufactures a line of rugged all-terrain vehicles, luxury cars, and engines for the general public.</Description>

    <Description>A small water-rich agricultural world, Kaumberg's lush woodlands also form its biggest cash crop, and the planet produces lumber that is used far and wide for anything from hand-crafted furniture to homes for wealthy elitists on timber-poor worlds.&#xD; In 3063, the Fed-Com Civil War came to Kaumberg. Stalled after years of careful slandering and well-delivered speeches in the Archon's name, Baron Franklin LeSat realized that to further his own political career, serious acts were required. Claiming to have discovered irrefutable proof of treachery on behalf of the Hasseldorf family, ancient rivals of the LeSat family, Baron LeSat called together the planetary council for an emergency meeting at the capitol building in Stuttgart. &#xD; There, a small force of LeSat units - bearing Hasseldorf family colors - brutally attacked the capitol building killing the majority of the sympathetic leaders to the Hasseldorf cause, in what would be latter known as the 'Stuttgart Massacre'. With both official and public opinion against the Hasseldorf family, Baron LeSat swayed the provisional government into thinking that the Hasseldorf family were then planning further military action against the remaining members of the planetary government. Baron LeSat then graciously volunteered his own troops for a coalition force to apprehend the renegades.&#xD; Having managed to escaped from LeSat's forces by the skin of their teeth, the Hasseldorf family secured the ComStar facility in the minor settlement of Tassuen, using its B class HPG facility to send for offworld aid. Baron Trent Hasseldorf, offworld at the time of LeSat's attempted coup, returned with forces to help defend his family.&#xD; After six months of hide-and-seek, the running conflict between the Hasseldorf and LeSat families had become a regular feature in the evening newsvids. The sporadic fighting, led both forces farther from Stuttgart and into the Ruhe Valley region on Regenwald, Kaumberg's primary continent. With both popular and governmental opinion beginning to move against him, Baron LeSat's coalition forces, now replaced entirely with his own troops and mercenary's, mounted an assault on the Hasseldorf forces settled within Ruhe Village, a tiny tourist town overlooking the large and eternally-placid Lake Ruhe.&#xD; With the battles being initially indecisive, Baron LeSat demanded the provisional government once again add its support units to his coalition forces and declare martial law on Kaumberg. Instead, the remaining members of the House of Lords ordered LeSat to stand down and moved to strip him of his authority as military commander of the Kaumberg defense force. Instead, LeSat ordered his home guard to arrest the entire provisional government. Declaring to the general public and his own troops that he had been given the authority to instate martial law, Baron LeSat ordered his remaining home guard units to secure Stuttgart, and the rest of his forces to take Ruhe Village.&#xD; With news of the coup leaking out, and Baron LeSat's true motivations now clear, forces rallied to the Hasseldorf cause ending in the utter defeat of LeSat's forces at Ruhe Village and leaving only token resistance forces at Stuttgart. Wanting to end the fight once and for all, the Hasseldorf forces marched on Stuttgart. Once there, Baron Hasseldorf challenged Baron LeSat to single combat. The Zeus of the Clan War veteran Hasseldorf, destroyed the Caesar of 'Social General' LeSat, thus ending the Kaumberg conflict.&#xD; The victorious Hasseldorf family and its allies spent the next week securing Stuttgart and locating the imprisoned survivors of the House of Lords. Stragglers from LeSat's fallen nationalist coalition and their sympathizers, who remained convinced that the Hasseldorf's intended to rule in place of the shattered government, complicated their efforts. By late September 3063, last of the missing leaders was accounted for and a provisional House of Lords called its first session together with a trial against Baron LeSat.&#xD; At the end of a week-long trial, Baron LeSat was found guilty of over 57 charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, treason and kidnapping. He and more than a dozen of his supporters faced a firing squad composed of troops from many of the conventional guard forces kept by the other planetary lords. The Hasseldorf family faced a series of lesser charges, but were exonerated due to the mitigating circumstances of the conflict LeSat had forced upon them. Offered the chance to serve the provisional House of Lords as regent until a new Lord of Lords could be elected by public referendum, Baron Trent Hasseldorf declined.</Description>

    <Description>Located far from its jump point, with hardly any water to speak of, an atmosphere too thin for unassisted breathing, and blasted by all manner of solar radiation from the blue-white subgiant around which it orbits, Kaus Australis would have been completely overlooked as a potential colony site if not for trace amounts of germanium and other valuable metal deposits just beneath its rocky surface. &#xD; The first settlers erected domed colonies along the banks of the Sea of Epsilon Sagittarius, the planet's only large body of surface water, located in the southern hemisphere. Radiation concerns and the discovery of limited subsurface water supplies, however, encouraged these hardy miners to move underground within a few decades. Relying on interstellar trade to survive, particularly with nearby water-rich but metal-poor Kaus Media, Kaus Australis exported the yield of its mines in exchange for water purifiers, foodstuffs, medical supplies, and all manner of other basic needs. The strong trade bond between the neighboring worlds eventually grew into a two-world alliance that lasted well into the Succession Wars.&#xD; Decisions affecting trade, defense, and social welfare were made for both worlds during this time at the alliance's capital on Kaus Media, an arrangement that often helped or hindered the ability of the Draconis Combine to exert its influence over the two planets when both fell under the Dragon's banner. Matters came to a head during the First Succession War, when Lyran agents-provocateur encouraged the alliance to rise against its Combine masters. The Kuritan response was swift and brutal, razing the alliance capital, occupying Kaus Media and briefly blockading Kaus Australis until both worlds turned over the Lyran agents and all dissident leaders. A negotiated settlement allowed limited autonomy and favored trade between the Kaus worlds in exchange for a more pro-Combine political line and hefty reparations that paralyzed their mutual economy for a time. &#xD; Even today, Kaus Australis maintains Kaus Media as its primary customer and source of goods, their symbiosis undeterred by centuries of war or the changing of allegiance to The Republic. The capital of Kaus Australis, Kaverni Bay, an underground community, is located fifty kilometers inland from the Sea of Epsilon Sagittarius. While home to a third of the planetary population - the remainder scattered in small domes and subsurface mining homesteads - visitors seeking to conduct business with the Kaus Australians are best advised to seek a Kaus Median facilitator first.</Description>

    <Description>A hellish world of continuous volcanic activity that geologists are attributing to a severe tectonic shift of unparalleled magnitude, Kaus Borealis is a world that many feel is on death's door. Over 300 active volcanoes have formed in the last three centuries alone, erupting with increasing intensity that now has lava flowing freely and regularly over almost ten percent of the planet's surface at any given time. &#xD; When first discovered, Kaus Borealis was a serene world of deep green oceans, fertile soil, hardy woodlands, abundant wildlife, and blue skies. The early colonists quickly made their paradise a home and established it as an agricultural world. Although, like most terrestrial planets, Kaus Borealis had its share of seismic disturbances, scientists thought little of them until three new volcanoes explosively emerged on the west coast of the northern continent of Lucynda in 2803, each within three months of the other.&#xD; As more eruptions followed, and entire towns or farming regions were swallowed up by the earth or incinerated by tons of molten rock, a gradual exodus began, which stalled in the thirty-first century when the planet grew inexplicably silent. However, by that stage so much sulfur, methane, and ash had been thrown into the atmosphere that the ozone layer was compromised, breathing was impossible without respirators, and acid rain regularly fell from dark, yellow skies. Gone were the serene oceans, fertile soil, and hardy woodlands, and most of the native wildlife had perished. Turbulent, superheated seas and barren wastes of broken rock and charcoal now dominated the landscape. &#xD; The capital of Kaus Borealis, Iamda, is located on the northern continent of Allysi, which lies east of Lucynda. Grand Cauldron, a newer city on the southern continent of Bellaria, is home to the largest of the planet's geological research facilities, the Gordon Weiss Institute of Tectonics, as well as the southern hub of the Kaus Borealis Planetary Evacuation Command. Rashatta, Kaus Borealis' fourth and smallest continent, located in the equatorial zones between Allysi and Rashatta, is completely lifeless, a result of the planet's brutal heat and the presence of no fewer than ten of its twenty largest active volcanoes.</Description>

    <Description>Kaus Media is a pleasant, terrestrial world with wide, deep oceans, expansive forests and jungles, and varied-yet normally mild-seasons. Yet, for all its natural splendor, the first colonists to explore and exploit this world quickly realized that the lack of easily reached indigenous metals and minerals would doom all efforts to develop their new home. &#xD; In the search for a source for raw materials to fuel their industry, traders from Kaus Media quickly discovered that their nearest neighbor, Kaus Australis, suffered from the opposite plight, surrounded by abundant and valuable raw materials, but lacking in food and water. A trade deal blossomed into a full-fledged alliance that carried the two worlds through the Age of War and continued even with the ascendance of the Draconis Combine.&#xD; Efforts by the Lyran Commonwealth to turn this alliance against the Dragon proved disastrous for the so-called "Kaus alliance worlds" during the First Succession War, when the enraged forces of the DCMS bombarded DeGuilles, the planetary capital city - and with it, the governing buildings that serviced both worlds. Only after surrendering the Lyran instigators and rebel leaders, and agreeing to stiff reparations and an oath of fealty, did the Kaus alliance avoid further destruction, but the entire crisis underscored the strengths and weaknesses of the symbiotic relationship now shared by these twin worlds. Trade between both resumed again decades after the crisis, though government was less centralized, with each tending to its own affairs from its own respective capitals.&#xD; Still, in memory of the broken bond, the people of Kaus Media never built over the ruins of DeGuilles. Instead, the new planetary capital, Vanguard City, located just forty kilometers to the north on the continent of Emparos, governs the affairs of this world, and maintains a diplomatic office for the benefit of its neighbor. Several major trading companies that do business under exclusive license with both Kaus planets also call Vanguard City their home, thanks to the presence of the planet's largest spaceport. Aside from Emparos, Kaus Media's other four major continents are Romana, Hyadamos, Gaul, and Normano. All but Gaul, the planet's frozen south polar continent, are populated with various small and medium-sized commercial and rural towns scattered along the shores of various rivers and lakes.</Description>

The Combine launched immediate punitive strikes against the rebels, with both the Fifth Sword of Light and Wolf's Dragoons assigned to flush resistors out of cities and other defensive positions.

Kawich's soil is generally poor, but its rocks are rich in metal ores, minerals, and petroleum. Although mining and refining industries boomed on Kawich under the Terran Hegemony, Kawich's population has always retained a frontier attitude given the hardscrabble land they must work. &#xD; After the fall of the First Star League, the Federated Suns laid claim to Kawich. Kawich remained under the banner of House Davion, except for a brief period during the Third Succession War when the Capellan Confederation held the planet. During the Fourth Succession War, House Davion lured House Liao into an ill-fated counterattack on Kawich involving famous units like the Eridani Light Horse and the Davion Guards. Today, locals still refer to the BattleMech carcasses on the hills and groves around the towns of Samanan, Jamou, and the capital of Dotara as "Liao's metal tombstones."</Description>

    <Description>Kaznejov is another sun-baked world. Only its modest ore deposits prompted colonization in the early 24th century by Russian miners. Since then, the populace has imported life-forms to make this world more habitable. During Star League days, settlers altered the weather with satellites, mellowing the climate to a peaceful, idyllic hum. These efforts to change the environment succeeded so well that the planetary government attracted many tourists with the slogan "The best planet mankind can build."&#xD; After the fall of the Star League, however, all efforts to maintain the delicate manmade environment of Kaznejov were forgotten in the fighting. Now, two of the three manmade oceans have dried up completely, leaving behind a desert of crystallized salts. Having fallen into disrepair long ago, the weather satellites work only sporadically, sometimes causing great storms that whip the growing deserts with wind and lightning.&#xD; The iron ore deposits, Kaznejov's only natural resource, were exhausted long ago. As there is nothing else of worth left here, the planet is losing its population. There has been talk of moving the prefecture capital from Gondovia on Kaznejov to Celeste City on nearby Waldheim. As the regimental headquarters of the 17th Galedon Regulars, Kaznejov frequently hosts skirmishes with Kurita units on the large barren deserts outside the military base.&#xD; To qualify for DEST, an individual must undergo an exhautive series of physical tests, including a two-week survival course under the burning heat of Kaznejoy's deserts and a course of training in pain resistance. Those that survive these assignments, must then complete a series of mental of ideological examinations to determine his or her suitability for DEST.&#xD; [3039] During the War of 3039, General Goran Yuu entered the Kaznejov system early on 26 August. After his fighter squadrons cleared the zenith jump point, he dispatched three mixed regiments from his First Crucis Lancers and the First Albion Cadre to the capital world of the Kaznejov Prefecture. Faced with the Seventeenth Galedon Regulars, the AFFS troops fought hit-and-run attacks for two weeks, frustrating the Combine defenders and doing what damage they could to the military infrastructure before they left. &#xD; History records this as a relatively minor action in the war, but Yuu�s forces did manage to destroy the prefecture headquarters and even kill Tai-sho Fatima Kori, commander of the Kaznejov Prefecture, an action that ultimately allowed Major General Miller to hold out on Capra for so long. General Yuu and his forces returned to the Federated Suns via the Waldheim and Delacruz systems, again a move aimed at confusing the DCMS intelligence efforts.</Description>

    <Description>One of the first worlds colonized during the interstellar Exodus, Keid remained in the hands of the Terran Alliance until the breakup of the Star League in the late 28th century, when Capellan troops occupied the system without incident. Located here are extensive commercial centers. Keid has greatly benefited from reclaimed Star League technology, and today supports many military installations, extensive training facilities, and scientific research     complexes. Its pleasant climate has also attracted numerous noble families, who have carved out substantial land holdings through the generations. The planet also boasts extensive commercial ore deposits. In later years the planet also became home to several training centers for Maskirovka covert-operations personnel.&#xD; After the Federated Commonwealth captured the world during the Forth Succession War, Keid - along with the other worlds of the newly named Sarna March - came under the rule of Archon Melissa Steiner-Davion. The Archon's benevolent rule seems to have fostered strong pro-Lyran loyalties among Keid's populace, loyalties that remain evident today.&#xD; Despite the Population's pre-Lyran sentiments, Keid's inhabitants never developed strong loyalties to the Federated Commonwealth. Following Melissa Steiner-Davion's death, many Keidans became openly critical of Prince Victor Steiner-Davion. These sentiments apparently laid the groundwork for the short-lived anti-Davion rebellion that occurred following the recent Marik-Liao invasion of the Sarna March.&#xD; The rebel leader - identified as Roland Carpenter - exploited the population's religious fervor and moral outrage as well in his attacks on Duke Joseph Hunsen. Revelations about the duke's relations with a pair of underaged twins with ties to a known agent of the Draconis Combine led to his ultimate fall from power.&#xD; Within a week, however, Carpenter mysteriously disappeared, and planetary militia leaders installed the late duke's daughter, Duchess Arice Hunsen, in power. The duchess immediately ordered the execution of several rebel leaders, granted amnesty to rebel fighters and pledged her loyalty to Archon Katrina Steiner-Davion's newly proclaimed Lyran Alliance. The Archon responded by sending the Thirteenth Lyran Guards to garrison the planet.&#xD; Although the planet seems firmly entrenched in the Lyran camp, Keid remains isolated from the Lyran Alliance. Kuritan peacekeepers on Rigel Kentares, ComStar troops on Terra, and the government of the newly formed Sirian Holds have all announced their intentions to prevent any military vessels from passing through their systems. However, this isolation has not yet prevented the government of Keid from espousing a pro-Lyran military and openly persecuting Davion sympathizers.&#xD; Roughly three quarters of Keid is covered by saltwater oceans. The planet's landmass is comprised of three mountainous, heavily wooded continents.</Description>

Originally known as Triesting-Kelang Weapons Industries, a company-wide reorganization of this major personal firearms producer for the LAAF and Lyran police agencies led to the shortening of the corporate logo to present a fresher look for today's post-Succession Wars market. Founded shortly after the Second Succession War by Rolf Scheddar, a retired LCAF infantry colonel, the company's focus has always been to create reliable, affordable and easily maintained infantry combat weapons. &#xD; Toward this end, many TK lines were designed with universal parts or use the same gauges of ammunition, allowing for ease of repair and maintenance from fewer parts kits � factors that made them an early favorite when the Lyran military shopped around for a reliable producer for its infantry rifles and submachine guns.&#xD; Today, TK Industries is the proud maker of the TK and Gunther assault rifle series. In the aftermath of the company's recent reorganization under Baron Harwin Scheddar, who assumed the helm in 3064, rumors have begun to float that the company is looking into expanding its Kelang factories to produce 'Mech-grade ballistic weaponry, and that Scheddar may soon achieve his publicly stated dream of being the first to unveil a Lyran-made TK rotary autocannon.</Description>

The creatures generate hive-like homes that, after the creatures move on, are ideal for human habitation. Although it takes decades for the organic dwellings to deteriorate, they begin exuding a smell that is equally unpalatable to humans and insects alike in just a few years. therefore they are abandoned regularly, and the areas in which they are constructed remain deserted for a century or more.&#xD; The principal industry of this rimward world is agriculture; its native strain of cereal grass is the staple diet of nearby worlds such as Lahti, Landfall, and Huntington. The extensive apiary industry uses a native bee-like insect for food and to produce honey. This product is sometimes mixed with the honey of Terran bees, which are also cultivated on Kendall. It is said that this product once deterred a Capellan invasion of the Free Worlds prior to the Second Succession War, as the Chancellor had no wish to cut off the supply to his breakfast table. The expression "smooth as Kendall honey" is common as far away as the Outworlds Alliance.&#xD; People on Kendall have always been the best-nourished in the Free Worlds.

    <Description>[2796] Kentares was the site of the infamous Kentares Massacre, one of the worst atrocities of the First Succession War. Due to the debacle at New Rhodes that Coordinator Minoru and the 6th Sword of Light 'Mech regiment had to make its way to Kentares IV. The loss of supplies on New Rhodes had stalled the Kurita forces' efforts to beat down elements of the 7th Crucis Lancers on Kentares. The Combine was now in danger of losing the planet completely. Landing there in early summer 2796, Minoru Kurita's units were besieged almost immediately by the aggressive and creative tactics of the defending 7th Crucis Lancers. Using sheer weight of numbers, Minoru forced his opponents onto a single continent. By late summer, he had nearly encircled them.&#xD; Outside New Snowfield, a small town nestled in the Carmelite Mountains, the Coordinator met his fate. Unable to pass up a chance to gaze upon the incredible scenery, Minoru left his Battlemaster and went on foot to the sunny alpine meadows, accompanied only by his lance members, a few guards, and a Buddhist priest. There the Coordinator and the priest sat among the trees, talking privately. No one saw the camouflaged sharpshooter from an infantry unit attached to the 7th Crucis Lancers as he made his way down the mountain. The shot from the sniper's laser rifle caught the Coordinator in the back. In the confusion that followed, the sniper managed to slip back up the mountain apparently not realizing whom he had killed.&#xD; When Jinjiro Kurita, heard of his fathers death it was with an eerie calm he  boarded a JumpShip, accompanied by a regiment of the Sword of Light. When Jinjiro Kurita arrived on Kentares, there was more bad news. A Davion force from across the front on Sonnia had rescued the remainder of the 7th Crucis Lancers. A few days later, Jinjiro gathered together all his commanding officers on Kentares and gave them one curt order. "Kill them all." When one of the officers attempted to ask Jinjiro for further explanation of the order, Jinjiro ordered that the man be shot by his Otomo. Without another word, the remaining officers left the tent to do their duty.&#xD; During the next five months, Kurita units on Kentares dispersed across the planet and began to systematically kill every citizen of the planet. The mass executions were accomplished by rounding up as many as possible in the cities, then using 'Mechs and vehicles to hunt down the rest. It was during the second month of this hellish activity that the Kuritans' military discipline began to waver. No matter how deeply indoctrinated with stoicism and obedience to the ruler, the duty of killing hundreds of people day after day was beginning to take its toll on the ordinary soldiers. Some were deliberately allowing groups of Kentares citizens to escape, and there were even reports of officers beginning to do the same. Soldiers had also begun to commit suicide because of the atrocities. &#xD; For Jinjiro, the thousands killed were no more than a number. To revive the sense of horror that his soul seemed to crave, he began to attend the executions. He even forbade the use of modern weapons at those he witnessed, preferring to see his victims beheaded by the sword. When Jinjiro had satisfied his revenge enough to leave Kentares in February 2797, he left behind a silent world plunged in grief. His men had massacred more than 90 percent of the planet's civilian population, amounting to some 52 million men, women, and children.&#xD; After the end of the First succession War, House Davion decided to repopulate the planet, largely as a gesture of defiance toward Kurita and his ancestors. With its industrial base smashed by the war, however, Kentares has never recovered its prosperity. Over the last 100 years, its population has again dwindled to just over a tenth of its pre-war total. Much of the planet is covered by ruined, rusting cities and factories, memorial to the carnage of the First Succession War.&#xD; With Kentares' bloody history, it is ironic that the illgrass plant native to the world must be fertilized with animal blood or it will die.</Description>

As hostilities continue, the prospect of spreading hatred is more likely. Riots on the nearby worlds of Hiwannee and Abbeville have already been reported.&#xD; In an attempt to stop the war, Kentwood has been divided evenly into three zones - as the planet is covered almost entirely by deciduous forests, this has not been a problem. The Treaty Zone, a neutral area bordered by the Christian and Hindu zones, houses most of the planet's industry.&#xD; [3056] The rediscovery of Star-League-era technology has allowed Cerulean Waters, one of the best-known Federated Commonwealth water-purification companies, to expand its operations and holdings, and the company has recently finished constructing a new purification plant in the Treaty Zone. This new industry has produced the Treaty Zone's greatest economic expansion. Unfortunately, both factions appear ready to resume the conflict to subdue their opposition, though many citizens fear the disruption the renewed war will bring to the Treaty Zone.</Description>

    <Description>With water covering almost all of its surface, and the remainder given over to ten large island masses and an assortment of smaller chains dominated by volcanoes, Kervil was quickly established as a mining world. Industries geared toward locating and exploiting the valuable metals churned up by lava flows arose within a decade of the planet's colonization. The Ozawa Mercantile Association, a collective of merchants that dominated the region before the rise of House Kurita and the Draconis Combine, took a liking to Kervil and its vast metal deposits. Through negotiations with the local government, the Association established its own offices, outposts, offshore mining rigs and orbital processing centers, maximizing the efficiency of Kervil's mining operations in exchange for almost exclusive access to the refined metals. &#xD; When the Dragon crushed the Association, these facilities, some damaged by Kuritan attacks, came under Combine control. At the peak of the Star League, Kervil's metal industry and orbital refineries became a major producer of ferro-fibrous armor and endo-steel, used extensively in the manufacture of BattleMechs and other military vehicles. It was perhaps for this reason that forces sympathetic to the Outworlds Alliance attacked Kervil during the Reunification War, attempting to demolish the distribution centers on the planet's surface after crippling several orbital factories.&#xD; A small BattleMech unit stationed on Kervil, part of the SLDF's 138th BattleMech Division, was all that stood between the renegade forces and total destruction. The woefully outnumbered SLDF troops put up a brave fight, first with hit-and-run attacks and later with an assault against one of the renegade DropShips, while waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Still outnumbered nearly 5 to 1, however, the defenders were forced to fall back to Fort Steel, their main base near the planetary capital of Iron City.&#xD; For three days they held out against a siege by angry renegades; then the enemy troops overwhelmed them and destroyed the fort and its defenders to the last 'Mech and soldier. This stand, likened to the battle for the Alamo on Terra, ultimately achieved its goal, as the departing renegades ran full-on into SLDF reinforcement troops on their way out of the system, losing the entire raiding force to the guns of SLDF WarShips. The brave SLDF defenders who died at the Battle of Kervil are still remembered today: Fort Steel's remains are a historic site open to tourists year-round. This battle, as it happens, was the only major military action seen on Kervil; even the SLDF liberation from Amaris the Usurper was comparatively bloodless. The planet was virtually ignored throughout the Succession Wars, save for some minor raids that destroyed the advanced armor metal plants in orbit and several military-grade metal refineries on the surface. &#xD; Today, despite these losses, mining and metallurgy remain Kervil's greatest industries. Iron City, still the planetary capital, is located on Greater Domain, Kervil's largest island continent. Greater Domain and seven other large island masses-Brahn, Northland, Satella and Lesser Domain in the north and Bellas Major, Bellas Minor and Karnophia in the south-support the majority of the planet's population and industries. The north polar continent of Freiholt and the equatorial continent of Infernus are sparsely settled, due to the extreme cold and lack of minerals on Freiholt and the chain of active volcanoes on Infernus.</Description>

    <Description>Kesai IV, also known as Kasai, is a hot, dry and desolate world with no native life. It has few mineral resources, and little else to recommend it besides once having a major Regular Army supply depot built on it's single continent.&#xD; Amazingly enough, Kesai did have settlers long ago. Though officially classified as a desert planet, it does possess scattered forests and woodlands in the temperate regions along the coastlands of the world's single sea. What attracted the colonists to Kesai, was the discovery of several deposits of radioactive minerals needed for the advanced electronics industry. When the deposits proved to be smaller than expected, only the few settlers who actually liked the hellish surroundings remained on Kesai. For a time, Kesai was used as a prison planet, first by the Draconis Combine and then by the Federated Suns after they took over the planet.&#xD; When the Star League came to power, it purchased the rights to Kesai from the Federated Suns. The League built a vast complex of warehouses, factories, maintenance facilities, and DropShip pads around the planet's single sea. The Regular Army used these facilities during most of the Star League era. After the League fell apart and General Kerensky and most of the Regular Army rendezvoused around New Samarkand, the Regulars stripped most of Kesai of its supplies. Soon after Kerensky's exodus, Davion troops moved into the supply depot and assumed control of Kesai. The huge warehouses were not as empty as had been expected, for the Regular Army had been forced to leave much behind in the rush.&#xD; Since the fall of the Star League, countless raids have reduced most of Kesai IV's cities to rubble, burned over tens of thousands of square kilometers of farmland and forest, and reduced the world's population to a tiny handful living underground. Several sharp battles have been fought within the woodlands which surround Kesai IV's spaceport at Shalmirat.</Description>

    <Description>Under the sway of the Federation of Skye, known for shrewd business practices and a preponderance of heavy industrial might, Kessel was already a valuable manufacturing center even before the dawn of the Lyran Commonwealth. It therefore comes as little surprise that the Draconis Combine, a poor realm �economically, if not militarily � would covet such a prize so close to their border, when the Star League collapsed and war broke out across the Inner Sphere.&#xD; House Kurita captured Kessel almost incidentally, during a drive toward Skye itself, and though the forces of House Steiner ultimately succeeded in driving back the Combine invaders, they never managed to reclaim several lost planets, including this one. The Combine saw great untapped potential in this mineral- and metal-rich world, with its many mining, refining, and manufacturing complexes that produced everything short of BattleMechs and DropShips. Thus, as Steiner forces continued to hit back over the centuries, making several failed attempts to retake worlds such as Kessel, the Combine took advantage of their possession, loosening industrial standards that protected the environment to increase output for their military needs. &#xD; Freed of the constraints found on other former Isle of Skye worlds, or any other industrial/corporate niceties, for that matter, the industries on Kessel turned to such questionable practices as strip mining and chemical dumping. Worse still, these practices also attracted the attention of the yakuza, the dominant underworld force of the Draconis Combine. Over the centuries, the results of these trends were a poisoned biosphere and a poisoned society. Crime was rampant, and might made right, except in those areas where the well-armed and equipped nobility resided. Visitors to this world are still cautioned to keep respirators on when outside their vehicles and buildings, to protect against the still-lingering toxins in the local air.&#xD; Kessel became a prefecture capital under Combine rule. Though it was raided several times, major corporations continued their operations on this world unabated, attracting even Inner Sphere-renowned manufacturers, such as Diverse Optics, producer of everything from home entertainment systems to military-grade laser weaponry.&#xD; Kessel's capital city is Sverdlovsk, located on the northwestern continent of Novgorod. The southern continent, Gershtad, is home to the planet's largest spaceport. Northeast of Gershtad is the Lobopov continent, home to what little remains of Kessel's untamed wilderness, and several defunct strip-mining operations.</Description>

Today the Cunninghams are consistently among the top ten wealthiest families in the Federated Suns. Much of the family concentrates on their expansive business empire, which was initially built upon an agricultural foundation but has since swelled to encompass a broader range of commerce. At the same time, there are those that have branched out to involve themselves materially within the political structures of the Federated Suns, though their opponents note that their relatives within the government are only out to look after their family�s concerns.&#xD; [3062] The units assigned to the Kestrel Combat Region were called into action a number of times throughout the Succession Wars, as the Combine pushed deep into the Suns, virtually placing the unit on the front lines. Though the Kestrel CMM has not been called into active service in more than a century, the unit retains many of the trophies of war it took throughout the years, including one fully functional Star League-era Thug once piloted by Coordinator Jinjiro Kurita and the battle standard for the First Sword of Light, taken in the unsuccessful battle for Robinson in 2854.&#xD; Leftenant General Vivian Petty is a career officer whose career stalled when she took command of the Kestrel Militia. Long past recriminations and resentment, Petty is now content with her position. Since her headquarters was a virtual museum of the AFFS history when she took charge of the unit, she has turned it into just that, earning a doctoral degree in history and sociology and eventually becoming the Crucis March's official historian.</Description>

    <Description>The mineral resources that initially drew humankind to Keystone have long been exhausted, but the factory complexes that grew up around them remain and have gone from strength to strength. Never a hospitable world, the industrialization of Keystone severely damaged its environment. Breather masks are a common sight across the planet and most buildings contain built-in air processing systems designed to scrub away manmade and natural pollutants.&#xD; Once the poisons are gone, the air is thin but breathable in the lowlands that make up two-thirds of the landmass, though most companies maintain at least part of their facilities pressurized to near-Terran levels. Earthwerks Inc, one of Keystone�s largest employers, is the only company to maintain all of its facilities in a Terra-like environment, having relocated its once-scattered sites to the domed city of Darras on the shores of Lake Marenga, the sole major body of water.&#xD; To save on life-support costs, most other companies maintain their heavy manufacturing facilities at ambient levels and rely on acclimated staff wearing breathers and environmental suits. The razor-edged rocks that appear everywhere on the planet require that most such suits must be armored, adding to their bulk. Hydroponics facilities provide a limited array of foodstuffs for the population, the native soil being too toxic to grow food suitable for humans, and Keystone is technically self-sufficient with these vegetables and yeast cultures. In practice, however, the planet relies heavily on imports for diversity, particularly animal products that are in short supply locally.&#xD; [3067] Once part of a trans-national engineering concern, Earthwerks-FWL survived the threat of nationalization by establishing its League assets as an independent corporation, related to but distinct from its cousins in the other Successor States. The corporation is the largest manufacturer of BattleMechs in the FWL�roughly fifty percent ahead of its closest rivals, Kali Yama and Irian BattleMechs�but it does its highest volume of business in civilian �Mechs used for logging, mining and construction. &#xD; Earthwerks also produces a broad range of groundcars, trucks and commercial vehicles, including a premium custom-order service (popular with automobile enthusiasts) and a contract building division making purpose-built industrial vehicles. This diversification primarily occurred in response to the Succession Wars that left many of the corporation�s military plants in ruins, but it also provided a steady steam of income not dependent on the FWLM budget � the Act of Parliament act that ensured the independence of Earthwerks - FWL also gave the League military the right of first refusal on the company�s military output.&#xD; The Fourth Succession War and the occupation of the corporation�s homeworld of Procyon led Earthwerks-FWL to relocate its administrative elements to its Mount Rochester facility on Keystone, complying with the requirement that League companies maintain their operational headquarters inside FWL borders or face reclassification as a foreign company (with all the accompanying tax and licensing issues). The corporation stands at the heart of the League military�s modernization, working closely with authorities to develop efficient and cost-effective upgrade kits and engineering protocols. &#xD; Much of the development work on such processes occurred during the dark days of the Clan invasion when AFFC and DCMS troops were the primary recipients, the lessons learned in such endeavors leading to the final version of many designs used by the FWLM. Earthwerks emphasizes practicality and efficiency over cutting-edge technologies, though its R&amp;D department is second only to Irian Technologies. &#xD; The present CEO of Earthwerks-FWL, Juri McMahon, has held the post since 3052. A native of Gallery in the Lyran Alliance, she is the corporation�s first non-League CEO since the onset of the Succession Wars. Her drive and determination have done much to counter innate League prejudice against Lyrans and have brought her into close association with the Captain-General, the first significant rapprochement between the corporation and the Marik family since Kenyon Marik attempted to nationalize Earthwerks� assets. Rumors on the business grapevine suggest that McMahon�s long-term goal is to reunify the entire Earthwerks corporation under her leadership, a claim seemingly backed up by increased contacts between Keystone and Earthwerks legacy companies in other realms.&#xD; One of the smaller manufacturers in the FWL, the Exeter Organization has managed to build a solid reputation with its core product, the Longscan series of communication systems. Contracts with the Word of Blake have prompted substantial investment at its Medway plant on Keystone, whose output has increased fourfold over the past decade. Much of this extra production went toward meeting foreign and domestic demand for Exeter�s systems � Earthwerks-FWL has become a major client in recent years � but Exeter has also scaled up production of its own vehicle, a variant of the Pegasus hovercraft.&#xD; Recently, some question has arisen as to Exeter�s independence. Rumors suggest the corporation is an Earthwerks-FWL shell, or that CEO Anup Tind � and by extension the entire company � are in the Blakists� pocket. The company has made no public statement on the matter, but its lawyers have filed suit against several news agencies in an effort to quell some of the more scurrilous stories. The legal action has merely heightened suspicions about the privately owned company.</Description>

Immediately on landing, the Jaguars found themselves battling armor elements attached to the Third. As the OmniMechs fought of the attackers, the Third's aerospace fighters launched a strafing attack on the Jaguar DropShips and severely damaged one of them before the Jaguar fighters forced the from the sky. The Jaguars then pursued the retreating armored battalion into Hecate's Swamp, where the Third sprung its deathtrap. The armored battalion's personnel mixed kerosene with the murky swamp water and set it alight, engulfing two Clan Stars in flames.&#xD; Infuriated by this underhand tactic, Khan Hoyt unleashed a Headhunter Star to decapitate the Third. Tai-sa Weston, commanding officer of the Third Hussars, died in the attack along with most of the command company. The Jaguars then forced the demoralized Third back to Collins Ridge, where the embattled Hussars made a brave but futile last stand.&#xD; [3059] Like many other first-wave engagements during Operation Bulldog, the battle for Kiamba was distinctly one-sided, particularly as the Smoke Jaguar commander deployed his aerospace fighters too late.

    <Description>Kimball II is the more heavily populated of two inhabited worlds in the Kimball system. Both the system and the worlds take their name from Lorenzo Kimball, a wealthy twenty-first-century industrial magnate from Terra's North American continent, whose family settled the system for the abundance of rich metallic resources on the planets and in the local asteroid belt. Though the Kimballs largely resided on Terra, members of that distinguished family financed and led the expeditions to establish colonies on Kimball II and IV. &#xD; Kimball II, by far the more hospitable world - if a bit warm - boasted ample water and agricultural resources on two of its four main continents, compared to water-poor Kimball IV's murky atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Thus, the bulk of the Kimball family's efforts went toward developing Kimball II. Rich veins of metal ores, particularly on the rocky desert landmasses of Vanassay and Warsaw - both of which straddle the equator - made them an ideal haven for mining and refining operations. Meanwhile, the fertile northern and southern continents - Hestelle and Triasha, respectively - became the basis for sufficient farming and ranching to sustain the population of both worlds. &#xD; Kimball II's exports, which mostly consisted of various industrial- and military-grade metals and metal parts for heavy agricultural, industrial, and military machinery, complemented the bauxite mining exports of Kimball IV, quickly establishing the Kimball family's dominance of the industrial metal trade in the region. This prosperity carried the Kimballs into their alliance with the Igota family of Thorin, an alliance that ultimately spawned the star-spanning corporate empire known today as Ceres Metals.&#xD; After the fall of the Star League, of course, the wealth of the Kimball system led to a series of battles for this world. By 2932, Kimball II had changed hands over a dozen times between the Lyran Commonwealth and the Draconis Combine. Fighting for the less hospitable world of Kimball IV was only slightly less intense, even though the planet's meager population and a defense force consisting of specialized helicopters presented minimal challenge to any invaders. The fighting ravaged much of the planet's industry, but thankfully spared most of the civilian population centers because of the distance between most of these communities and the planet's major industrial centers. &#xD; The capital and spaceport city of Lorenzopolis, is located on the southern continent, Triasha. Lorenzopolis is also home to a branch office of the still-active Ceres Metals corporation.</Description>

    <Description>[3028] During the Forth Succession War, Kirchbach was one of the targets of the second wave. A Prefecture capital, and thus an important military target, the battle that unfolded on the plains near the capital of �stersund held much greater meaning for the local population. When the Lyran forces landed on Kirchbach, they unveiled a completely unknown regiment. The Tyr Regiment was made up of assault 'Mechs, painted dark blue and bearing the emblem of the Tyr underground movement; a gold viking helm set above a silver star representing the Rasalhague Principality. &#xD; To both the locals and Combine defenders, the appearance of this regiment seemed almost miraculous. Their arrival and subsequent victory over the defending Seventeenth Rasalhague Regulars galvanized the Rasalhague loyalists into beginning riots and worker strikes across the entire planet. This, combined with planned sabotage by the Tyr underground, paralyzed the planet's economy, transportation and administration systems and made the Combine defenders feel as if they were fighting on enemy soil. The two-pronged approach to conquering the planet succeeded better than either the Tyrs or the Lyrans had hoped.&#xD; [3050] Clan Wolf landed on Kirchbach in June 3050. Defending the world were the Third Kavalleri, and the First Kirchbach Armored Regiment. The Wolf warriors used the local media to their advantage as the advanced towards the Kavalleri. The inexperienced defenders were so terrified by the Wolf propaganda that when the two sides finally faced each other at the snow-covered Thorson�s Hollow, the Kavalleri panicked and fled. �verste Barrie Fraga managed to escape offworld with a battalion of her �Mechs.&#xD; [3054] As part of their plan to build a 'Mech plant on Kirchbach, Swedenborg Heavy Industries first constructed a ballistic weaponry facility, which was to provide components for the Free Republic's other factories while the rest of the complex was built. The Wolf Clan's invasion put a stop to production. ComStar believes that Clan Wolf may be trading components to the Ghost Bears from the Kirchbach and Rasalhague factories for the armored vehicle plant on Spittal held by Clan Ghost Bear. In exchange, the Wolves receive electronics from Trondheim for use in the 'Mechs they produce on Satalice.</Description>

    <Description>During the early years of Shiro Kurita's Alliance of Galedon, each populated world agreed to send a percentage of its citizenry to New Samarkand for indoctrination and military training. &#xD; On one occasion, the lush agricultural planet of Kirei Na Niwa failed to do so, falling short of its  quota by less than 20 persons. Before three months had passed, the world had lost exactly double the requisite percentage of its population in mass executions orchestrated by Shiro Kurita and carried out by his brother and warlord, Urizen Kurita. No world ever missed its quota again.</Description>

    <Description>Tentra, the large moon of Kirkcaldy, was once home to a Pitban Power Systems fusion engine factory. The Edasich family (stewards of the planet Edasich in the Isle of Skye) assumed control of the plant soon after the fall of the Star League in 2784.&#xD; The predations of the Succession Wars heavily damaged both of the company's primary engine plants, severely curtailing their output, and by 3025 the Tentra plant was barely operating at one-fifth of its former capacity. Due to layers upon layers of jury-rigged systems, the factory could no longer be repaired. The discovery of the Helm memory core enabled then-CEO Duke Martin Edasich to reverse this trend and make good on his plans to establish at least one of his factories farther away from the front. &#xD; Further spurred by rumors that DefHes would soon expand its Tharkan engine plants to offset the loss of Edasich productivity, the duke spared no expense in the massive undertaking for a new facility on Aur, dismantling the aging Tentra plant for parts in the process. The Aur factory, one of the first to come on line offering extralight fusion plants for BattleMechs, reassured DefHes executives and ensured Edasich Motors' continued vitality in the post-Succession Wars era.</Description>

    <Description>The planet Kittery was part of the Capellan Confederation until the Federated Suns seized this small agricultural world in an offensive begun in 3005. Since then, the planet and its people have been a thorn in their side.&#xD; Outside its farmlands, dense jungles cover much of Kittery. Travelers in these wild regions risk running into viscous native predators such as the godan, a dog-sized lizard that hunts in packs of up to twenty.&#xD; The planet's population, of mostly Asian ancestry, has been less than cooperative with their new rulers, despite the many freedoms they enjoy as a world within the Federated Suns. In the 20 years since the Davion occupation, Kittery has spawned a particularly vicious guerilla organization known as the Kittery Tong. While the Military Governor would prefer to spend her time preparing against possible attack by the Capellans, she must occupy most of her day worrying over reports of the latest Tong attacks or of jungle predators lately feasting on her troops.&#xD;  The only positive note in the strained relations between the occupation forces and the planet's population is that the Federated Suns has allowed many Buddhist temples to open in the cities of Kittery. An increasing number of people curious and eager to rediscover the religion of their ancestors have been attending the temple services.&#xD; The capital of Kittery is CanFu City.</Description>

    <HasFactory>false</HasFactory>
    <Description>[3039] One of the first wave of targets in the War of �39, Klathandu IV was a poorly-defended border world that represented nothing more than a stepping stone to further operations in later invasion waves. An arid, sparsely populated world, most of the planet�s settlements are located around the world�s scattered oases and shallow, land-locked seas. Only select regions possessed any arable lands and most of the world�s industry was located in the capital city of Klanthis. &#xD; With no significant opponent to stand in his way � the planetary defense consisting of a few lances of BattleMechs, and a citizen�s brigade - Marshal Winston Vaskursian contacted the planet�s leaders before even touching down on Klathandu IV, in an effort to prevent any damage to the world�s fragile infrastructure. Like most Combine bureaucrats, Governor Hishashi Kodama refused Vaskursian�s terms; the people of Klathandu IV had a different opinion, however; Klathandu Federation President Kori Trenn contacted Marshal Vaskursian an hour later and agreed to his terms. Further, she offered to turn Governor Kodama and his senior staff, who had been arrested minutes earlier, over to the marshal.&#xD; By the time the Seventh Crucis Lancers and Second New Ivaarsen Chasseurs landed on the world in early May, Marshal Vaskursian and President Trenn had agreed on the specifics of the occupation and eventual transfer of the world into the Federated Suns. The people of Klathandu IV continued on, their lives all but unaffected, while the invasion force landed and �stretched their legs.� As none of his forces were scheduled to participate in Wave Two assaults, Marshal Vaskursian�s units were able to devote all of their time and energy into forging a relationship with the world�s citizens.&#xD; After learning of the Combine counterattacks in August, Vaskursian and his troops redoubled their efforts, and at the same time constructed what fortifications they could in expectation of an eventual DCMS strike on the world. At this point, Klathandu�s population began resisting assimilation. Though happy to participate in efforts to strengthen their homeworld�s infrastructure, Klathandu�s population did everything they could to passively resist constructing or strengthening fortifications and other military facilities on the world � whether or not those facilities were located within their cities.&#xD; Tai-sa Samuel Nelson led the DCMS task force consisting of the Third Benjamin Regulars, the Second Galedon Regulars and two regiments of conventional troops,  landing on 4 August. Tai-sa Nelson landed his forces on the plains of Pere Caplais, and before Marshal Vaskursian could react to that move he struck at the city of Pere Urucin, an important industrial city and major agricultural transportation crossroads on the world. Nelson�s quick assault with more than two total regiments of mixed forces drove Vaskursian�s two scant battalions out of the city. That move gave the Combine forces a base of operations from which they could continue their re-capture of the world.&#xD; Over the next two weeks Vaskursian detailed several reconnaissance companies to keep track of Nelson�s movements. For his part, Nelson pursued a relatively conservative strategy � at least for a DCMS officer � methodically moving from one target to the next, striking each with overwhelming force. Marshal Vaskursian and his operations staff soon had a good handle on their opponents, and waited for Nelson to mount his next attack. When Nelson struck Therisk on the 21st, Vaskursian launched his own counter-attack � reinforcing Therisk with two quick-response battalions, whilst the rest of Vaskurian's forces struck at the flanks of the Combine assault force. Vaskursian�s two provisional brigades shocked Nelson�s forces, driving them away from their attack on Therisk. From that point, the two forces sparred fiercely.&#xD; For the next month and a half, Marshal Vaskursian and Tai-sa Nelson battled each other, while the people of Klathandu IV actively resisted both sides, doing their best to keep the fighting away from their cities and farmlands. The lines of battle really did not move much one way or another, but by the beginning of October, it was obvious that Nelson�s forces were all but finished. Of the more than eight regiments of troops he led to the world, he had less than nine mixed battalions left, and his supply situation was critical. Vaskursian began to push more and more, driving the proud but exhausted Combine warriors ahead of his own columns.&#xD; That drive lasted six days and ended back at Pere Urucin, where Nelson prepared to make his last stand. Vaskursian launched his final assault in the early morning hours of 11 October. After three days, Nelson was still barely holding out. Pere Urucin was in flames, and dozens of burned-out tanks and BattleMechs littered the edges of the city. The DCMS troops had concentrated themselves into a small defensive ring, which in turn Vaskursian�s fighters and artillery were savaging. &#xD; But then Marshal Vaskursian received a dispatch from New Avalon ordering him to give up the assault and to return to the Federated Suns. Those orders stunned the marshal and his command staff, but the accompanying intelligence reports demonstrated without a doubt that the invasion had failed. Vaskursian�s forces broke off the attack on 14 October and pulled off the world fifteen days later, leaving Tai-sa Nelson and his two under strength regiments � less than a quarter of the forces he�d led to the world � in command of Klathandu IV.</Description>

    <Description>Once a hardy agricultural world in the Terran Hegemony, Ko continued to be a breadbasket for the people of the Draconis Combine's Dieron Military District after the fall of the Star League. Though some desert regions - such as the region surrounding the former capital city of Jarlton, on the equatorial continent of Hyadei - are plagued by the occasional sandstorm, much of the rest of the planet's main landmasses boasts fertile soil, coupled with excellent growing cycles and the ability to support both domestic and imported flora and fauna. &#xD; As a result, numerous farming, fishing, and ranching industries came to call Ko their home, and before long several shipping lines and food-processing megacorporations were doing the same. By 3025, by far the largest of these was Surinami Processing, a producer of all manner of processed foods from freeze-dried survival rations to its Home Helper line of canned and boxed foods, with a special Happy Life Meals division that also provided foods for every institution from corporate cafeterias to volunteer soup kitchens. Interestingly enough, however, Surinami's most controversial product, the Stomach's Joy line of nutritional supplements, never saw widespread use in the Combine, and was ultimately the cause for the company's shutdown soon after Ko was captured by the Lyran Commonwealth in the Fourth Succession War.&#xD; After the conquest, when Surinami began marketing Stomach's Joy to select Lyran markets, reports of the food's unusual side effects eventually drew an inquiry into the company's practices and processing standards. What was discovered was that Surinami Processing was indeed mixing a host of organic byproducts from their various other food products into Stomach's Joy as a cost-saving ploy, and blending it with native-grown narcotics in relatively undetectable amounts for added "flavor." Public outrage and the Lyran government's subsequent fines ultimately spelled the end for the Ko food-processing giant.&#xD; [3062] In mid-July 3062, elements of the Fifteenth Dieron Regulars raided into Skye, prompting outrage. Without consulting his superiors, Colonel Pitcher ordered his 1st Skye Jaegers to stage reprisals, targeting the Dieron Regular's home base on Ko. He was surprised to find the DCMS unit already back in its cantonment, but pressed the attack anyway, inflicting grievous damage before withdrawing. Unfortunately it was this raid - together with allegations of other Lyran action against Combine "peacekeepers" - which led to Theodore Kurita formally annexing the Lyons Thumb for the Draconis Combine.&#xD; Though privately acknowledging Colonel Pitcher's involvement, the LAAF has dismissed Kuritan claims, including a DCMS denial that the Fifteenth attacked Skye. The LAAF claim the Kuritan Coordinator and First Lord fabricated the evidence to further his own position, but leaked documents revealed the Jaeger's involvement and undermined the Alliance's position. The exact details of what happened in the Lyons Thumb remain shrouded in mystery.&#xD; During the Lyran assault, the planetary capital city of Jarlton was badly damaged, forcing the Combine to relocate the administrative centers back to the pre-Fourth Succession War capital of Hagitasu, on the southern continent of Kyushu.</Description>

    <Description>When Kobe was first colonized early in the 25th century, it was a very young world.  The continents had just finished forming, the volcanoes were newly silent, and the seas recently calmed.  By the heyday of the Star League, the colonists had transformed Kobe into a beautiful world filled with species from over a hundred worlds.  Kobe became a fashionable vacation resort for the rich, and even First Lord Cameron and his family once spent time on the Della Islands.&#xD;  But the Star League fell.  That same year, Kobe entered another volcanic phase.  The citizens of the planet became convinced that the two events were somehow related.  Of the five continents that were heavily populated at the time of the League's fall, only two are now capable of sustaining life.  The other continents fell prey to almost constant earthquakes and volcanoes.  There were many catastrophes during the 30 years after the eruption of the first volcano; the worst and most bitterly ironic was the eruption of Mount Millay, whose pyroclastic flows and lava covered the city called New Pompeii.  The climate of Kobe immediately changed from tropical to subarctic because of the tons of volcanic ash in the air.  Cities had to cover their streets and filter the air.  Green became a color of the past.&#xD; Kobe still manages to be a major producer of computer electronics and chemical engines.  The recent eruptions of Mount Augustine and Mount Tilson on one of the remaining inhabited continents puts the continued habitation of Kobe in doubt.&#xD; [3051] The planet Kobe holds a special place in the hearts of Clan members because it is one of the many "paradise worlds" found in Clan mythology. The truth behind this myth is that Kobe was a popular vacation spot during the heyday of the Star League. Khan Garth Radick and his Arctic Wolves were disappointed when they landed in December 3051, to find a world ravaged by volcanic activity. Against Beta Galaxy stood the 26th Lyran Guards RCT, who had been pushed off Tamar, and the two battalions of 'Mechs from the First and Second Kobe Mechanized Brigades.&#xD; Beta gained the upper hand in the first battle, fought in Ash Valley, when Elementals slipped through the Lyrans' lines and killed Hauptmann General Joy Corelli. Command fell to Leftenant General Jinders Green-Davion, who showed remarkable composure and leadership in regrouping the 26th Lyrans and stopping the rout. Subsequent battles made it clear, however, that the RCT had been hit too hard to keep the Wolves away from the political and industrial heart of the planet, the reclaimed capital city of New Pompeii. The 26th Lyran Guards retreated offworld to Thun.</Description>

    <Description>A somewhat cold world, colonists were drawn to Komephoros by the promise of abundant natural resources trapped beneath its partially frozen surface. Unfortunately, the first settlers sent to this world vanished without a trace, their fate unknown until a second colony ship was launched to the world nearly a decade later. Finding no sign of the original expedition's JumpShip, the second expedition assumed its predecessor had simply misjumped until - after setting up a settlement on the temperate shores of the equatorial Marksenia continent - a scouting party dispatched to the southern continent of Calvinar picked up a very weak, automated distress signal, originating from what appeared to be a frozen lake. &#xD; Further investigation eventually uncovered the grisly remains of the first colonial expedition, which was apparently washed out in a freakish disaster caused when a rogue asteroid struck the nearby ocean with sufficient force to generate a wave that flooded the valley their settlement had been established in. When the planet then entered its three-year-long winter cycle, the newly formed lake froze over, and subsequent snowfall eventually buried even the colonists' DropShip from satellite scans. To this day, local legends say the lake, dubbed Luega del Condenado (Lake of the Damned), is haunted by the spirits of the lost colonists, and no modern settlements have been established within 300 kilometers of the site.&#xD; Over the centuries after the fall of the Star League, Komephoros traded hands a few times between Houses Steiner and Kurita, with many of its mining and ore-processing facilities damaged during each shift in control.&#xD; The capital city of Komephoros is located on Marksenia's east coast, and is also home to the planet's primary spaceport. Bristalle, largest city on the northern continent of Jasonri, boasts a secondary spaceport.</Description>

Stories of their good deeds quickly began to flood the popular media. &#xD; One such deed occurred on Koniz in 3037, after a series of volcanic eruptions threatened to destroy the world's largest city. ComStar 'Mechs and troops guarding the nearby HPG facility began to construct walls, ditches and waterjet positions that eventually forced the lava rivers away from the city.&#xD; [3060] Situated along the Lyran Alliance's border with the Jade Falcon Occupation Zone and a mere two jumps from the Falcon Headquarters on Sudeten, Koniz is a natural hotspot for military activity. In the past ten years the world has been subject to dozens of Clan raids and has served as a staging area for at least eight different retaliatory strikes. Accordingly, its defenders have fortified the world heavily.&#xD; Unfortunately, since Grand Duke Kell's creation of the ARDC, the LAAF has left the defense of the world solely in the hands of the Koniz PTM. Though operating some of the oldest equipment in the Lyran inventory and provided with barely enough supplies to remain operational in a peacetime environment, the Militia has nevertheless thrived in the face of repeated Falcon attacks. However, the lack of support from the LAAF, combined with a particularly close working relationship with Khan Phelan Kell's Alpha Galaxy has pushed the unit firmly into Prince Victor's camp.&#xD; The militia maintains literally thousands of fortifications and emplacements all over Koniz. That, in addition to the unit's intimate knowledge of the world's geography, insures that any attacker will pay dearly for every inch of the world they win.</Description>

    <Description>Brutally hot and muggy much of the time, Konstance suffers from an overabundance of carbon dioxide that casts a haze over the planet and traps heat from its weak, K-class sun. Once necessary to give life on this world a fighting chance, this environmental taint, already present to a much lesser degree when colonists first set foot here almost a thousand years ago, has been aggravated by centuries of human development. &#xD; Despite efforts to control the greenhouse-effect problem in its infancy, the presence of large underground pockets of petrochemicals and natural gas inevitably led to a series of drilling and refining industries that helped develop Konstance, but over time added to the atmospheric pollution. Konstance thus continued to grow hotter over the centuries, to the point where the effects of this global warming have forced the local population to move into the cooler polar reaches of the planet.&#xD; Unfortunately, despite the decreased presence of heavy industry in the middle and equatorial latitudes - save a few automated pumping and refining facilities occasionally tended to by visiting laborers and technicians in special environmental gear - the planet continues to grow warmer with each passing year. The abandoned cities and towns of the planet's interior landmasses of Juranias and Tiburia - including the former capital city of Konstantinople - have gradually been reclaimed by Mother Nature, with hardy but mutated rain forest trees, fed by acid rains, growing through the crumbling remains of streets and buildings.&#xD; Tropical storms, also the result of the planet's shifting climate, have rendered travel into and through these regions a chancy proposition, so most transcontinental travel is accomplished either through suborbital DropShip hops or by the use of submersible passenger vehicles. While this complicates administrative and commercial business on Konstance somewhat, especially in the formation of distinctive "northern" and "southern" subcultures, it has made raids against this world over the last century or two an equally complex affair as hostile parties must often try to coordinate a two-pronged assault to tie up local defenses, which have long since grown accustomed to the quirks of Konstance's heat and tempestuous weather. &#xD; The capital city of Konstance, Ishtalia, is located on the southern polar continent of Perragea, and also doubles as the southern hemisphere's largest spaceport city. Its counterpart on the north polar continent of Epigaus, Lazarus Bay, also boasts the planet's largest submarine seaport, which ferries over half the harsh-environment workforce for local fuel producers like Axis PetroChem Unlimited.</Description>

    <Description>The name of this planet was taken from an infamous book written by Michael Kooken. The book described Kooken's curious life and the many people he had met and bedded. The book was so famous and popular that a planet was named after the hero's legendary mansion.&#xD; In an attempt to shut down the Malthus family on Dustball in 3005, the Steiner government decided to create Kooken's Pleasure Pit to compete with them. Though he encountered much protest for the plan, Archon Alessandro believed that putting the largest organized crime family out of business justified the means.&#xD; Tourism is the planet's only major industry. Kooken's remarkably temperate climate and wide variety of terrains offer many more diversions than does Dustball's desolate landscape. In certain cities, those who pursue sensual pleasures can find what they seek. All businesses plying the sexual trade must submit to government regulation on age, health, and working condition laws for the benefit of the men and women employed by such establishments. Those who are not actively associated with the pleasure industries can live elsewhere on Kooken's, places where the strictest laws forbid visits by over-hormoned tourists.&#xD; Whether or not this attempt to rival Dustball has worked is debatable. Though traffic in and out of Dustball has decreased in recent years, many feel that the Malthus family's criminal activities are too massive to be defeated by simple business competition.&#xD; The planet itself is resource-poor, though recent attempts to grow some exotic grains for commercial use have met with some success.&#xD; Holo Entertainments, is a large entertainment industry based on Kooken's Pleasure Pit. This firm is a major producer of holos ranging from every possible subject, from classic gothic romance to pornography from its DeSade Division. There is also an electronics division that converts standard holo stations into pay-per-view stations, which is the only way many of its holos could be seen on some worlds. The company is also the major publisher of pornographic books, records, and sensory discs through its Velcro Fly logo.&#xD; [3054] This disreputable world is frequented by border troops on R&amp;R. Because of this, would-be Clan raiders always run into more forces than expected.</Description>

    <Description>Covered by open plains and sandy deserts, Korramabad punishes its inhabitants with a hot atmosphere that only the hardiest can tolerate. The inhabited area lies on the southern continent, which is slightly cooler because of a ring of high, rocky mountains threaded by narrow passes and deep gorges. Korramabad is one of the Inner Sphere's leading suppliers of industrial diamonds.&#xD; [3056] Korramabad is currently in the midst of a revolution launched by Sir Timothy Bentlen in an attempt to unseat the ruling Duke Taikara Imushiu. Duke Imushiu, a die-hard supporter of the late Coordinator Takashi Kurita and the old Kurita ways of combat, has ruled over the citizens of Korramabad cruely since coming to power. Bentlen supports Coordinator Theodore Kurita and his reforms and intends to make these changes felt on his home planet.</Description>

    <Description>[3052] Clan Ghost Bear landed on Krenice in March 3052. Defending the world was the Fifth Amphigean Light Assault Group. The Fifth Amphigean attacked the Ghost Bear forces from concealed positions amid the natural crags of Bellow Canyon, unleashing a devastating rain of fire as the Bears touched down. They then scattered throughout the rock formations and raided the Clans's supply lines, disrupted communications, and even launched an occasional assault. The Twelfth Bear Chevaliers heavy 'Mechs spent most of their time chasing the lighter, swifter machines of the Fifth, and eventually flushed them from hiding using their air assets. &#xD; The Bear 'Mechs herded the Fifth toward the city of Hasnorvan, in the opposite direction from the Fifth's DropShips. Making the best of a bad situation, Tai-sa Helen Cassidy ordered small number of troops to detach from the Fifth's main body and engage in hit-and-run assaults against the pursuing Bears. In one evening raid a company of the Fifth led the Twelfth on a merry chase through LightDraught Woods for two hours, until the Bear warriors got lost and called on aerospace observers to guide them out of the trackless forest.&#xD; Just outside of Hasnorvan, the Twelfth took the Fifth by surprise. Star Colonel Douglas Silva had ordered the 63rd Assault Trinary to march toward the city ahead of the Bears' main body and dig in, and so the 63rd was waiting as the Fifth approached the city's outskirts. As soon as the Fifth came within firing range of the dug-in Clan 'Mechs, all the Clan forces opened up on the defenders. The web of interlocking fire decimated the Fifth within hours.&#xD; Prior to their destruction, the Fifth were able to carry out the Combine's newly instituted "scorched earth" policy. So thorough were the Fifth, it is hard to believe this ruined planet was once the site of much of House Kurita's industry.  The Ghost Bears were glad to gain Krenice, nonetheless, because it makes an excellent base from which to raid into a densely populated portion of Combine space.</Description>

The battle itself was unusual in two aspects. The first was the almost total lack of daytime fighting, a result of battling in the extreme southern latitudes of the planet. The second was the ferocity of the Kufstein defenders, particularly the Second Kufstein Mechanized Regiment, which was made up entirely of women. Trinaries First and Second Striker (of the Eleventh Wolf Guards) defeated the defenders in just seven days, a feat typical of their skill; that they did so with only light casualties was remarkable.</Description>

    <Description>[3033] The end of the Forth Succession War left Wallacia and Kujari located between the militaristic and newly independent Duchy of Andurien and the Capellan confederation. When the Internal Emergency Act of 3030 stripped away league member worlds of their sovereignty, Wallacia and Kujari formed a mutual defense pact and declared their independence from the Free Worlds League in 3032. On Wallacia, the Second Oriente Hussars, who garrisoned the world, quickly moved to seize the capital. As internal conflicts prevented the League from pressing the attack against Kujari, Wallacia/Kujari negotiators hired the Black Widows Battalion to restore sovereignty on Wallacia and to protect them from the Confederation.&#xD; The ruckus on Wallacia signaled to Chancellor Romano Liao, that the region was indeed vulnerable. Kujari, was not only a tempting target for invasion, but also served as a temporary base for the hated Black Widows. Reluctant to endanger her valuable regular units, Romano decided to send four widely-divergent battalion-sized mercenary units for the assault - Steele's Eagles, a veteran unit fresh from Periphery service; McCrimmon's Light Cavalry, badly mauled during the Forth Succession War; Rivaldi's Hussars, a green and so-far untested unit; and St.Cyr's Armored grenadiers, another inexperienced unit. These units were grouped uneasily under the command of Colonel Donovan Steele, leader of the Eagles.&#xD; During the initial landing on Kujari in 3033, Steele attempted a Dragoon-style deception, with two of his battalions coming in with maximum sound and fury. He hoped to draw the Widows into battle, then smash them with the remaining two battalions hidden in a polar orbit. Unfortunately for Steele, Natasha Kerensky recognized the plan for what it was, and the Widows' aerospace forces soon forced the remaining DropShip to land. Steele's forces then attempted to fight their way through to each other. After a brutal 45 minute engagement, the Widows were forced to withdraw, presenting them now with a numerically superior, and almost unassailable enemy.&#xD; Outnumbered almost two-to-one, Natasha Kerensky decided to use a bit of deception of her own. That night, Dragoon DropShips descended, scattering chaff and ECM pods, to confuse enemy detection. The Widows aerospace elements kept the enemy air units at bay while, apparently, the Black Widows boarded their DropShips and left the world. To his credit, Colonel Steele was not convinced that Kerensky had truly left. Remaining on alert in his HQ, a fortified agricultural station, Steele sent out patrols to search for evidence of Dragoon deception. For almost three weeks the patrols continued.&#xD; Finally, the patrols slackened, and after a further week, the surviving Widows came out of hiding and assaulted Steele's HQ, determined to decapitate the invasion force with a single blow. As fires and explosions lit up the compound, Steele called out a challenge to Natasha Kerensky herself. Impressed by Steele's bravery and skill, she accepted, and the two moved into thunderous close combat. In the end Kerensky's battle-worn Warhammer, one arm hanging useless, stood above Steel's vanquished Marauder.&#xD; Guessing that Steele possessed a mercenary's hard-nosed common-sense, Kerensky called on him to surrender and order his battalion to follow suit. After a moment, he complied. Unwilling to face Romano's wrath, Steele's Eagles accompanied the Widows back to F-C space, where they quickly established a successful reputation, occasionally going so far as to subcontract with their former foes, Wolf's Dragoons.&#xD; As the government's of Wallacia and Kujari had anticipated, both planet's rejoined the Free Worlds after the rebellious Anduriens were brought to heel. But the superior military position obtained by the Black Widows, enabled both governments to wring considerable concessions from the League negotiators.</Description>

    <Description>Kuzuu is a quiet, mostly agricultural world known for long, reasonably mild seasons, particularly in its middle-latitude continents of Oahana and Entiko. A large world, with modest deposits of industrial metals and other valuable resources, Kuzuu developed heavy industry very slowly compared to most of its neighbors, as a majority of the original settlers preferred the quieter farming and ranching life to the hustle of heavy industry and commerce. &#xD; Because of this, the planet was largely overlooked by raiders throughout the Age of War and the first three Succession Wars, a factor that helped protect its natural beauty and even drew those seeking a return to the simpler life. In the Fourth Succession War, Kuzuu went from being an interior world of the Draconis Combine to being the front line against future FedCom aggression, perched just beyond the tip of the united Commonwealth's new "Lyons Thumb." The increased military presence this new position warranted led to a boom in local industry and the economy to support the planet's defense, and so, by the close of the thirty-first century, Kuzuu boasted a population of more than two billion, almost equally divided among urban and rural population centers.&#xD; The capital city of Kuzuu, Arbeesi, is located on the industrialized northern continent of Shanaro.</Description>

Sitting in lavish, soundproof rooms amid the smoke of fine dryweed, some inveterate gamblers will even wager on the flip of a coin.&#xD; The serious-minded, idealistic, Thomas Marik has not tried to shut it down.

The planetary government maintains law and order - after a fashion - by means of a highly efficient, well-trained, security force. It is said that death is preferable to imprisonment in Kyeinnisan's penal colony.&#xD; The "Holy Rollers" are maintained by a tax imposed on casino owners and the various other merchants involved with supporting the world's gaming and other entertainment industries. Such people might not have been motivated to pay these taxes, except that not doing so meant a serious drop in profits when their premises were no longer patrolled or monitored, and became too dangerous for most patrons. It is also rumored that individuals with enough wealth and power could engage the security force for their own purposes.&#xD; The capital of Kyeinnisan is Luck City.&#xD; Kyeinnisan is governed by an oligarchy.</Description>

    <Description>La Blon is a tropical world almost completely covered by water. Its three main landmasses, Elise (in the northern hemisphere), Ballay, and Renaria (in the southern), are more like large islands than continents, and each is surrounded by a host of smaller island clusters. This, combined with the planet's warmth and typically moderate weather - except during the "wet seasons," when tropical storms and hurricanes become more of the norm - has made La Blon a favorite vacation spot for tourists. &#xD; Despite this allure, it was the abundant natural resources of the planet and its inhabitable moon, Ivanov, which drew colonists here centuries ago. A wealth of common metals and modestly fertile soils have given La Blon a subsistence-level economy in mining, light manufacturing, and even agriculture, more than enough to supplement its seasonal tourism trade. These features made La Blon a favorite corporate retreat during the height of the Star League and again under Lyran rule during the height of the Federated Commonwealth alliance. La Blon became known as the place where one could go to get away from it all and still be connected to the real world.&#xD; Though the planet's exports offered very little of military value, raids were not uncommon during the Succession Wars after the Star League fell. Fortunately, these raids did little to mar the natural beauty or seriously disrupt the local economy and infrastructure of this planet. While this has limited any actual fighting that happened within the system over the centuries, the people of La Blon eventually earned a reputation for na�vet�, assuming that war either could not touch them, or that its effects would only be a slight disruption, like mid-flight turbulence.&#xD; La Blon's capital, Amadeus, is located at the foot of the Carbondale Mountains on Elise. The city is also home to the planet's largest spaceport. The coastal city of Lisellei, on the Renaria continent, boasts the planet's largest seaport, and is home to the Diamond Mine, easily La Blon's largest casino resort.</Description>

Unfortunately for the Fifth, Clan Jade Falcon had also learned new methods of fighting the Inner Sphere. A Headhunter Star of Elementals assassinated Hauptmann General William Galloway. His aide, Colonel James Allison, led several ambushes against the Jade Falcon forces before he was vaporized in his 'Mech by the concentrated fire from an Assault Star of OmniMechs.&#xD; Clan OmniMechs combined their fire several times during this battle, frequently when FC MechWarriors committed some breach of Clan honor, but also from tactical necessity. The Jade Falcons adopted this firing technique specifically to counter Inner Sphere battle tactics.&#xD; [3053] The 13th Donegal Guards spearheaded a raid against La Grave in 3053, their mission to deprive the invaders of the industrial facilities of Bissau. Supported by independent infantry and armor regiments, the Guards - known as the Black Cats for their reputation for success against the odds - exploited the wooded terrain surrounding the city. They remained concealed from the Clan defenders and seemed to strike from nowhere, then faded away before an effective counterattack could be organized.&#xD; Frustrated by these tactics, the second-line garrison troops withdrew and the raiders easily accomplished their objectives. However, the garrison Cluster decided to focus its attentions on the FedCom LZ to force the Donegal Guards to fight their way clear. The 13th lost almost a quarter of its personnel, mostly in the wild melee as they sought to leave the planet.&#xD; [3064] During the Falcon Incursion, Khan Vladimir Ward's Wolves attempted to make inroads into the Falcon's Occupation Zone. The 13th Wolf Regulars hit La Grave during December 3064, though were unable to consolidate their hold on the world. Unlike the Coventry Campaign of seven years previously, Khan Marthe Pryde was ready for a Wolf attack into her OZ and had troops in reserve.&#xD; With the aid of the 5th PGC, the defending 1st Falcon Velites, 22nd Provisional Garrison and 74th Battle Clusters, forced the 13th Wolf Regulars to withdraw with heavy casualties, having only suffered light casualties themselves.</Description>

This unusual planet has caused the downfall of more than a few nobles who could find no use for Lackland. Some have attempted to export the water, but it proved too costly. Others attempted to become successful through aquaculture. When they began to breed marine life as food delicacies, dangerous unknown creatures rose up from the depths of Lackland's ocean and swallowed the pens of fish whole. The people of Lackland like this situation just fine, however, preferring to bask in the sun and to live on the fish they catch themselves.  The current Marquess has taken a new tack in an effort to develop Lackland. He has begun to build underwater habitats against the walls of the undersea cliffs. From these habitats, it may be possible to mine the mountains for chemical compounds and metals. The results have been promising so far, though some of the habitats have been menaced by the huge creatures that the natives know as "The Mothers of the Ocean".</Description>

    <Description>A cloudy atmosphere, laced with too much sulfur and carbon dioxide to breathe safely, covers Laiaka in a hazy gray shroud. Though this atmosphere all but blocks out the light from its dull red star, this atmosphere traps enough solar radiation to produce higher than expected surface temperatures. Initial colonization efforts overlooked Laiaka for this reason, but during the ascent of the Federation of Skye, an expedition to this world discovered impressive deposits of industrial materials, including titanium and germanium, beneath the steamy surface. &#xD; Mining settlements soon arose, particularly on the northern island continent of Geir. Rather than erect expensive domes, the settlers built their cities underground, making use of their expanding mining tunnels and natural subterranean caverns - some even large enough to accommodate 'Mech traffic - formed by geologic outgassing. Early terraforming efforts were underway by the dawn of the Star League era, with vast expanses of genetically tailored algae employed across the global seas to convert some of the excess carbon dioxide to oxygen. The effort was only partially complete, however, when the Succession Wars began. &#xD; As a wealthy border world, Laiaka suffered from numerous raids throughout the Succession Wars. Though determined defenders and Laiaka's own unpredictable subterranean labyrinths often thwarted these invasions, the centuries of raiding set back terraforming efforts. Laiaka's atmosphere returned quickly to its natural state, a steamy near-toxic hell preferred only by the native flora. The planetary capital, Bunker City, is located on Geir's central plains, on the shores of the Great Geir River, and features Laika's few surface structures, including the gantries of the Bunker City Spaceport. The southern continent of Preiska, however, boasts its own local capital and spaceport city, Yaleston.</Description>

    <Description>In many respects Lambrecht was considered an ideal candidate for colonization. Abundant mineral and metal deposits, ripe for mining and refining on the surface and in the orbiting debris field from a failed moon, promised a booming industrial economy, while fertile soil, terrestrial seasons, and a biosphere suitable for human life all described a virtual paradise. The only drawback, settlers quickly learned, was that the planet was entering a stage of geological settling, stirred constantly by gravitational tides caused by its large G6-class sun. &#xD; The resulting earthquakes, common all over the world, have generally been mild, but prevented the colonists from establishing large structures or concentrated cities, a trend that continues despite advances in building materials and planetwide expertise in earthquake damage-control procedures. As a result, Lambrecht's five island continents are dotted with small to medium-sized towns, the largest of which, the planetary capital of Middle Park, boasts a population of just 967,000.&#xD; During the Star League era, Lambrecht became one of the League's most heavily fortified worlds, ironically enough, because of its chronic tremors. As home to the University of Lambrecht, one of the Star League's "Golden Ten" institutions of higher learning, and a school geared toward the hard sciences (such as physics, astronomy, and geology), the League chose Lambrecht as a test bed for a Castle Brian design using high-boron alloy, a rare building material resistant to earthquakes.&#xD; Six Castles Brian were constructed on Lambrecht by the mid-twenty-fifth century, including one that housed the Success Mint, which printed currency for the Draconis Combine. During the Amaris crisis, Lambrecht was hit pretty hard, with the Usurper's troops obliterating four of the Castles Brian, the University of Lambrecht, and the Success Mint, from orbit. Using neutron weapons on the ground to capture and secure the remaining two, Amaris' forces dug in when Kerensky's troops returned to liberate the planet. In the ensuing battle, Kerensky's troops used their own tactics against them, raining fire down from several orbiting WarShips to destroy the core of Amaris' defenders, then overwhelming the surviving troops with sheer numbers on the ground. &#xD; In the month-long fighting, the Usurper's troops, employing a scorched-earth policy, destroyed all of Lambrecht's high-boron alloy mills and several nearby towns. Even today contaminated zones still trace the sites of these major battles that heralded the fall of the Star League, and the air is tainted by toxins left over from the biochemical weapons the Amaris forces employed near the end.&#xD; The Draconis Combine claimed Lambrecht after the League's fall and immediately tried to scavenge from the remains of the ruined fortifications and university facilities left behind by Kerensky's troops. In three cases, they uncovered substantial, largely undamaged catacombs beneath the collapsed ruins of the legendary Castles Brian, all three of which - including one just fifteen kilometers south of Middle Park - are major tourist attractions today.&#xD; Aside from the large island continent of Galapagos in the northern hemisphere of this world, where Middle Park stands, Lambrecht's four other continents are Brattanios, and Falkos, in the northern hemisphere, east of Galapagos, and Phillipharos, and Shasia in the south. Shasia, dominated by tundra, is by far the least populous of these landmasses, but recent discovery of an untapped boron vein has awakened some interest in mining the metal for the possible rebirth of the high-boron industry.</Description>

The outcome of the short, brutal fight was a forgone conclusion. The green Rasalhague regiment fought bravely but offered no real opposition to the elite Clan force, though the repercussions of the battle would change the face of Clan Ghost Bear. &#xD; When the Ourse Keshik, led by Khan DelVillar, raided a Freemen ammunition dump of the 24th June, �verste Knute Kurita's defending company opened fire on the charging Clam 'Mechs and, surely by chance rather than design, scored a direct missile hit on Khan DelVillar. Her Point scrambled to remove her from the battlefield, but the damage was done. Khan DelVillar slipped into a coma from which she would never emerge.&#xD; Khan Bourjon secured Last Frontier, then immediately convened a meeting of all available Bloodnamed warriors to vote for a new Khan. MechWarrior Aletha Kabrinski, the Clan's current Oathmaster, earned the title of Khan by defeating stiff competition. Her first official statement as saKhan was to suggest to the assembled warriors that Khan Bourjon, while a competent warrior, was not leadership material. Her statement echoed the sentiments of many Bear warriors, whom felt that the Clan's poor performance to date could accurately be blamed on the Khan's lack of competence. She called for one of the warriors present to challenge Khan Bourjon for his position, and nominated Star Colonel Bjorn Jorgensson for the honor.&#xD; Caught completely off guard by this show of no confidence, Khan Bourjon called for a vote to determine the extent of his warrior's discontent. The warriors voted unanimously to choose a new Khan, then voted to elect Star Colonel Jorgensson as Clan Ghost Bear's new Khan. When Khan Bourjon called for a Trial of Refusal, Khan Jorgensson choose to accept personally. Because he was a poor hand-to-hand fighter, Khan Bourjon chose to fight augmented, even though to do so gave Khan Jorgensson the advantage of his aerospace fighter. The battle took place in the tropical jungles of Last Frontier's equator, and ended with Khan Bourjon accepting Jorgensson's offer of hegira.&#xD; [3062] During the Combine / Ghost Bear War, the Eighth Sword of Light launched a raid against the lightly defended Dominion world of Last Frontier, while the Clan�s frontline forces were busy engaging Combine regiments elsewhere.

However, neither of the Captain-General's Concord of Kapteyn allies cared much for this attitude. Strongly worded communiqu�s from Chancellor Liao and Coordinator Kurita convinced Janos Marik that he had no choice but to help both states. With great reluctance, the Captain-General set in motion what became Operation Dagger.&#xD; October 1 saw the operation underway, with Marik forces appearing in five Commonwealth star systems, including Launam. Despite heavy fighting that lasted until late November, Marik forces managed to capture all five planets. They also conducted heavy raids against numerous other Commonwealth worlds in an attempt to force House Steiner to pull units from the Draconis front.&#xD; Though initially amazed at Operation Dagger's success, Janos was horrified when he received news of a terrible occurrence on the planet Scarborough - namely, a clash between Marik forces and Capellan units taking refuge on the world. The Duchy of Andurien, always, a volatile and rebellious member of the League, immediately declared war on the Capellan Confederation. In less than a day, the Captain-General went from successful conquest of several hard-won worlds, to fighting a desperate two-front war.&#xD; When the lull came in early 3029, the Marik forces breathed a sigh of relief, believing that they might have time to pull their realm out of the war. This was not to be however, when regiments from the newly formed Tikonov Free Republic attacked four Marik worlds. Even as the Republic forces were invading, Lyran forces invaded the League world of Callison. News of the Marik Guard's defeat on Callison worried the League's generals, and the apparent preparations for a massive invasion of the League by Commonwealth and Republic forces brought them to the edge of panic.&#xD; Janos Marik reasoned that he could not save the planets threatened by the imminent invasion, but he could save the units stationed on them. On July 28, he issued orders to all troops Terra-ward of a line between the planets Callison and Wasat to evacuate immediately, as well as on the worlds captured in Operation Dagger. In his fear he gave up fourteen worlds that he might have saved. He did not know that the Commonwealth had no intention of launching an offensive, and that their messages implying such a scheme were a bluff. This single deception allowed the LCAF to absorb in a few weeks worlds that should have taken months, if not years to conquer, all without firing a shot.</Description>

    <Description>[3039] Of any of the individual planetary assaults planned as a part of Operation Orochi - the Draconis Combine�s feigned counter-invasion of the Federated Suns during the War of 3039 - the strike on Le Blanc was perhaps the most important. Instead of landing normally in their DropShips, the Ghost battalion assigned to the world - under the direction of the Kanrei�s wife, Tai-sa Tomoe Sakade - was infiltrated onto the world through a variety of means.&#xD; On the other hand, Le Blanc was then, as it is now, an �open world� that not only serves as an important trade hub but also is home to several popular alternate mercenary hiring halls (though those hiring halls have lost considerable prestige and popularity since the coming of the Clans). Sho-sa Homan Chokei brought a company onto the world disguised as a mercenary unit looking for employment, while two more companies of �Mechs were shipped to the world disassembled as a part of a major shipment of industrial and AgroMechs. &#xD; As much of an open world as Le Blanc may have been, it was also headquarters to the Robinson DMM; though that march militia may have been spread across four worlds in forward-deployed positions, a significant force remained on Le Blanc, primarily stationed outside of Port Paix at Fort Mason. Those DMM forces represented the greatest threat to Sakade, and she knew she would have to neutralize them first.&#xD; But the Robinson DMM was not the only objective in striking Le Blanc, or even the most important. Kanrei Kurita knew he did not have enough forces available to truly threaten the Draconis March and still repel the coalition invaders. He needed help, and there was plenty available on Le Blanc in the form of unemployed mercenary forces looking for assignments. Sho-sa Chokei made initial contact with quite a few mercenary commanders in June � his company along with other elements of the Fourth Ghost were rushed to Proserpina as soon as the extent of the invasion became clear � informing Tai-sa Sakade upon her arrival which were the most �likely� candidates for what they needed.&#xD; Surprisingly enough to Sakade, negotiations with the mercenaries she approached were both cordial and easy, undoubtedly aided by the fact that she paid the mercenaries up front in cash or commodities (including Germanium). She bought the services of almost three more battalions of troops � less than she had hoped, but enough to accomplish the mission � and immediately had them dressed to look like the rest of the Third and Fourth Ghost Regiments. On 6 July, the Ghost, aided by many of the mercenaries, struck Fort Mason, taking command after a lengthy battle that put what was left of the three Robinson DMM regiments on the run.&#xD; Sakade remained on the world for most of the rest of the month before breaking the combined Ghost-mercenary regiment she led into four battalion-sized battlegroups, three fronted by a Ghost company. Sho-sa Chokei remained behind on Le Blanc with two battlegroups while Sakade led the other two deeper into the Draconis March.&#xD; Chokei still had nearly the run of the world, however. Le Blanc�s population, content to live their own lives so long as they weren�t adversely affected, did not interfere with the progress of the fight, making the DMM�s �defense� of the world even more difficult. Ultimately, it took the arrival of the Second Ceti Hussars RCT, redeployed from Robinson after that important world had been secured against possible invasion, to secure the Le Blanc.&#xD; Commodore William Kossacks, commander of the Hussars� air group, used both his fighters and many of the RCT�s combat DropShips to aerially assault the Combine forces. After just the first day, it was obvious to Kossacks and RCT commander General Hobart Rader just how small a force Chokei had at his disposal. The Ceti Hussars attacked with all their might, both shocking most of the mercenaries with the strength of their air group and confusing them with the effectiveness of their mixed compositions. Ultimately, the great majority of the mercenaries surrendered rather than be destroyed; one company did manage to flee the world. Sho-sa Chokei�s company died to the man, however.</Description>

After the Davion Military Intelligence and the MIIO learned of her intentions, Prince Peter moved to reinforce the world. For the first time in years, Peter Davion entered a battle to direct the planet's defense.&#xD; In a three-day battle on and around Lee, the Davion defenders crushed the Capellan attack. In the air, the AFFS AeroSpace Fighters crippled the Capellan air strike force, and succeeded in knocking out 40 of them. This left the Capellan 'Mechs, tanks, and infantry on the ground without the full weight of the massive air support they needed. At that point, Prince Peter led his Davion 'Mechs in an attack that easily pushed the Capellans off Lee, with heavy casualties. The Capellans had lost so many fighters in "The Great Lee Turkey Shoot," as the battle came to be known, that it took them years to regain their former strength.</Description>

Trinaries First Striker, Second Striker, and Fighter (of the 352nd Assault Cluster) had no concept of this type of warfare, and so were unable to anticipate the militia's actions. Though the world has officially surrendered, guerrilla activity still occurs sporadically.</Description>

    <Description>Only a narrow band of Les Halles supports human life comfortably; massive ice sheets engulf much of the planet and leave only twenty percent of its surface water in liquid form, mostly in the equatorial Auverne Sea. Even where ice does not dominate the single pseudo-continent of Orl�ans, the harsh and rocky landscape requires considerable effort to clear and make suitable for farming. The planet�s strategic location, however, has made control of it a major issue for the League and the neighboring Capellan Confederation, from both a military and a commercial point of view. Whether in Marik or Liao hands, Les Halles has served as a key trading port, its starport-cities surrounded by vast warehouse districts and equally extensive bazaars. As with Kalidasa on the Lyran border, the government closely monitors such trade, but it is widely acknowledged that almost everything available in the Inner Sphere can be bought on Les Halles, either legally or via the extensive black market.&#xD; A relatively small number of goods are produced on-world, with trans-shipment and reselling the focus of the planetary economy. The mining and refining of spacecraft fuel is Les Halles� principal heavy industry, though the past decade has seen the establishment of an orbital repair complex designed to serve as a hybrid maintenance facility and cargo way-station. On the planet itself, vast expanses of hotels, bars, bordellos and restaurants service the largely transient population of the port cities. Only in more isolated districts and in the capital of Beauborg does the permanent population dominate, residing in settlements dug into the planetary crust to protect them from the harsh weather.&#xD; Most settlements on Les Halles are built around an atrium, a large open central area off of which commercial and residential districts lie. All that varies is the scale of construction � a house may have rooms stemming from a central subterranean courtyard (complete with reinforced-glass roof), while a town may comprise a series of interlinked cathedral-like atria.&#xD; [3039] In mid-August 3039 the Fifth Marik Militia pushed back a Liao probe against Les Halles, widely believed to be a response to the Ninth Marik Militia�s raid on Capella in July. The CCAF attack was half-hearted and failed to inflict any significant damage on the Militia or the market world�s infrastructure.</Description>

Reaching an average height of 150 meters, these trees are also the home of the mailsloths favorite food: nests full of native flame ants.&#xD; Mailsloth meat is considered a delicacy by many gourmets in the Inner Sphere. Because of the relatively few remaining specimens - mailsloths live mostly alone and reproduce very, very slowly - the planetary government of Lesalles issues a handful of hunting permits each year.&#xD; Though the creature usually lives up to its slow and dull-sounding name, mailsloths are no easy prey. Their scaly hide is surprisingly resilient to damage, even from attacks by modern weapons. In addition to that, the beasts get an adrenaline boost when agitated, enabling them to flee with unexpected agility and quickness.</Description>

    <Description>One of the five worlds of the Rim Commonality, Lesnovo has recently been subject to bandit raids from the Marion Hegemony in the Periphery. The people of Lesnovo feel abandoned by the Atreus government, despite Janos Marik's continued concern with preventing incursions by any Periphery powers.&#xD; The industrialized areas of Lesnovo line the edge of the planet's larger continent. The shores of the continent feature sandy plains sloping up to limestone cliffs. The entire inland area is suitable for farming and is divided by rolling green hills into separate landholdings.&#xD; There is not that much to take from Lesnovo. Only its proximity to Marian space makes this planet a target: its food production is barely enough to feed its own population, and there is nothing to export to bring in wealth. Consequently, the raids have taken what little the people of Lesnovo have. This has led to bitter denunciations of the Marik government in the Free Worlds Parliament, and even suggestions from some Rim Commonality representatives that replacing the Mariks with another House might be in order.&#xD; All this has not escaped Catherine Humphreys. House Humphreys is a good candidate to replace House Marik, and Dame Catherine, as the most capable of the loyal opposition leaders, would be the logical choice for the Captain-Generalcy. The question of how much support she could muster throughout the rest of the Free Worlds is undoubtedly what stays her hand, but there is little doubt that the government and people of Lesnovo would support her claim.&#xD; [3025] Lesnovo is governed by a feudal autocracy.</Description>

Following several spoiling raids during the Succession Wars, the last three Chancellors have seen fit to maintain a local garrison on the planet.  Today, elements of the Capellan Hussars use Liao for summer training maneuvers.  The Liao family maintains a palatial residence in the northern hemisphere.  Otherwise, the planet remains largely uninteresting militarily or industrially.&#xD; [3025]Recent reports indicate Maximilian has shifted elements of the Warrior House LuSann regiment to Liao for "special maneuvers," though the reason for these maneuvers remains unclear.&#xD; [3063] One of House Liao newest military academies, the Liao Conservatory of Military Arts was established four years ago. The first class of graduates entered military service in 3062, to much acclaim. Half of them went to the newly formed Heritage Guard regiment of the Capellan Hussars, which may handpick from each graduating class. Another significant portion of that class entered service with the Forth Tau Ceti Regulars, at that unit's request.&#xD; So far, the Conservatory is living up to its promise to bring out the best in its students. Nicknamed the "thinking warrior's academy" for its devotion to meditation and its emphasis on individual effort, this facility is more concerned with accentuating personal strengths than with shaping its students to fit a recognized mold. Most courses are self-paced, allowing recruits to speed through subject areas for which they demonstrate particular aptitude. A recruit who passes a test in one area may use the time saved to focus on other subjects or practices, either those he finds difficult or those he enjoys most. Regardless of a student's progress, they are never allowed to forget that they are at the academy because they wish to be there, in service to House Liao.</Description>

    <Description>[3039] During the War of 3039, Lima was one of the worlds targeted primarily by mercenaries. Like the other worlds involved in these mercenary-supported actions, Lima was once a part of the Federated Suns but was lost to the Draconis Combine during the Fourth Succession War. And, along with McComb and Royal, Lima was one of the first worlds to be struck prior to the war � in March of 3039 -  a move that Prince Davion hoped would either draw forces away from other targeted worlds or would convince the DCMS High Command that any further actions would target border worlds.&#xD; Sitting on the border of the Combine and the Draconis March, Lima and its people still had close ties to the Federated Suns, with a good percentage of the population steadfastly anti-Combine. Because of that, the AFFS High Command knew the fight for the world would be easy � there were but a handful of true Combine supporters and the rest of the world�s population only wanted to be allowed to live their lives, an attitude shared by most border world peoples.&#xD; The one hitch in the plan happened when McGhee�s Cutthroats were delayed almost three weeks by drive problems on their JumpShip. Rather than wait for their �Mech reinforcements, though, special forces teams launched their attacks, quickly neutralizing much of the Combine government. Some significant militia units did escape the initial strikes, though, and took to the field � ultimately taking control of the industrial Kijmegen Province. Once McGhee�s Cutthroats were on-planet, however, the few battalions of militia infantry were no match to the mercenaries and quickly folded.&#xD; Federated Suns Civil Assistance teams began to arrive on-world in late June, and by the end of the war regular trade was already flowing into and out of the Lima System. McGhee�s Cutthroats spent several months preparing for the worst during the Combine�s counterattack in July, August and September, though the DCMS ultimately never made a strike at Lima � at least for several more years (the DCMS would target Lima with raiding attacks in 3043 and 3046). &#xD; In short, Lima returned to the Federated Suns with little difficulty and almost no loss of life.</Description>

At first his regiments made remarkable progress, having attacked a region of space where the AFFS had few resources remaining - most being tied up in the ongoing civil war. &#xD; Meant only to be punitive raids, these successes prompted further strikes with the Taurian regiments now believing they could reclaim their ancient homeworlds, and pay the Federated Suns back for their losses in the Reunification Wars. The Pleiades Hussars crushed all resistance on Lindsay in less than fortnight.&#xD; By early 3067 however, and with the civil war coming to an end, Duke George Hasek was able to send a massive force of AFFS regulars and mercenary units to cut the Taurians off and repel them.</Description>

    <Description>A quiet, terrestrial world of varied landscapes, lush temperate zones, and adequate resources to support a low-level industrial society, Lipton is a curious planet. Prosperous, yet not overly so, Lipton achieved self-sufficiency in short order, and its early settlers, a mix of western European and North American peoples, came to enjoy their frontier life and trade with neighboring worlds. &#xD; When the Outer Reaches Rebellion broke out, Lipton's populace rebelled through passive resistance, refusing to offer up its people to serve as troops for the decaying Terran Alliance. Self-sufficiency lent the Liptoners a sense of independence that remained with them throughout the Star League era, and during the centuries afterward as part of the Lyran Commonwealth's rebellious Skye region. During the FedCom Civil War, in fact, many of the locals sided with the cause of Free Skye. The defeat of that secessionist movement, however, took the wind out of their own spirit of rebellion. &#xD; Today, Lipton is once more the quiet, industrious world it once was, though still regarded as something of a backwater. The greatest planetary export, in fact, is textiles, with Redstorm Fashions, Incorporated (a local clothier owned by the planetary governor) among the largest single corporations invested here. Unlike most worlds, the capital of Lipton City is not home to the primary spaceport on planet. Instead, most visitors arrive and depart through the interplanetary/suborbital traffic hub of Brannigan Field, located on Suresta, Lipton's equatorial island-continent, which offers connecting flights to points on the Noresta, Western and Eastern World continents.</Description>

Caesar�s Cohorts arose from former members of the Marian Hegemony�s Praetorian Guard who left their homeworlds in late 2795, rejecting the piracy that had by then become an accepted way of life among their former brethren. They formed the Cohorts on the principles they believed the Praetorian Guard had been meant to follow. Life was not easy for this burgeoning command, as contracts came few and far between for a unit with no experience. &#xD; Despite contracts with the Lyran Commonwealth and Free Worlds League, the Cohorts failed to make it within the Inner Sphere, and so returned to the Periphery. In the Magistracy of Canopus, they found refuge and more garrison employment, taking up station on Lockton in 3030. They were soon drawn into the Andurien-Canopian invasion of the Capellan Confederation in September of that year, and performed better than their Canopian counterparts, thanks to their experience of fighting House troops.&#xD; On Drozan, the Cohorts put up a spirited defense against Kincade�s Rangers and even deflected one assault from elements of Warrior House Dai Da Chi, however Major Orosco ultimately withdrew the Cohorts, knowing the Capellan force was more powerful than his employer realized. Since then, the Cohorts have returned to defending Lockton, working in tandem with Ramille�s Raiders.</Description>

These great reptiles of prey (whose wingspans measure upto 16 meters) can be broken and ridden as beasts of burden or war. Hundreds of adventurous souls come to Lopez's shores each year to make the attempt. All attempts to export these strange and wondrous creatures offworld have failed, however, as the Branth is highly susceptible to disease.&#xD; [3050] The recent perfection of a vaccine that bolsters the branth's fragile immune system has allowed traders to export the branth offworld.

When groups like the Citizens for Davion Purity and Action Democratic began violently clashing, new troops highly trained in anti-riot actions arrived to bolster the police forces, threatening to devolve into civil war. &#xD; Rather than be forced into action against Lothair's people, the Eighth's Major General Palu removed Lothair's governor and declared martial law. She then used her Fusiliers to disarm every faction not willing to stand down and recognize her power, leading to a number of quite brief encounters with local police and anti-terrorist units. Though this action concluded in July 3062, Lothair remains under martial law until Duke Hasek appoints a new governor.&#xD; [3066] Expecting a Davion invasion of the Taurian Concordat which never came, the now paranoid Protector Shraplen ordered his own strikes deep into the Federated Suns. At first his regiments made remarkable progress, having attacked a region of space where the AFFS had few resources remaining - most being tied up in the ongoing civil war. Lothair fell to the Taurian's without much of a struggle in late 3066.&#xD; Meant only to be punitive raids, these successes prompted further strikes with the Taurian regiments now believing they could reclaim their ancient homeworlds, and pay the Federated Suns back for their losses in the Reunification Wars.&#xD; By early 3067 however, and with the civil war coming to an end, Duke George Hasek was able to send a massive force of AFFS regulars and mercenary units to cut the Taurians off and repel them.</Description>

    <Description>Loxley was settled by the embittered Scots-Irish refugees from the Stewart Confederacy. Having been forced off their colonies of York and Lancaster in 2346 by the Protectorate of Donegal, the luckless ex-Confederates gained a respite just long enough to raise their families and plant their roots.&#xD; In 2378, Lyran Commonwealth Archon Robert Marsden, on a tour of the Commonwealth's holdings, arrived on Loxley. Expecting to find a small Lyran agro-colony on the world, Marsden was startled to find instead an independent community of over 15,000 people, with a highly developed cottage-industry base. Marsden quickly claimed Loxley as Commonwealth territory (and part of his personal estates) and invited the doughty natives to join him as part of his loyal constabulary. When the people refused, an enraged Marsden ordered his men to occupy the planet by force.&#xD; This time, the Confederates fought back, but their sticks and stones were of little value against laser rifles and sonic mortars. Less than 1,500 Confederates - 10% of the original population - managed to survive the carnage, escaping in a lone JumpShip. No longer nursing any hopes of peaceful coexistence in the Inner Sphere, the Confederates headed into the Periphery.&#xD; Originally known as Norse Technologies, a major 'Mech producer during the Star League, Norse-Storm technologies of Loxley was re-formed in the mid-3030s when Colonel Griff Storm of the newly formed Storm's Metal Thunder mercenary command discovered the ruins of the original factories. Aided in the endeavor by general government loans and financial aid from Samuel Norse, a descendant of the Norse family who originally ran the Star League-era facilities, the newly incorporated Norse-Storm Technologies unveiled the super-heavy Devastator in 3048, immediately winning several contracts with the FedCom government to produce more.&#xD; By the mid-3050s, Norse-Storm had expanded its operations with a second facility on Solaris VII. Manufacturing five powerful 'Mech designs � most based on Star League-era schematics and making use of advanced technology � the company has enjoyed remarkable growth as a supplier to Lyran and mercenary interests. However, detractors of this "upstart" company often point out that some of Norse-Storm's most popular ventures � notably, the Maelstrom and Nightstar BattleMechs � would perhaps sell less well had they not been jointly devised alongside the larger, more financially secure FedSuns-based General Motors BattleMechs.</Description>

Although the fad eventually petered out, the Academy continued, with backing from both major vidtape networks. &#xD; This has placed the Academy in an odd position. Some of the best performers in the League were hired and given carte blanche to provide the networks with a constant stream of talent and ideas. Then, unsatisfied with the results, the networks tried to control the curriculum by manipulating the purse strings and hiring practices.&#xD; The turnover among the teaching staff is high, although teachers may be fired and rehired several times, depending on which creative direction manager is in power at the networks. The Academy is currently seeking independent backers from a powerful House to sustain its struggle against censorship. Along with the standard (and sub-standard) vidtape fodder, it is turning out original and exciting actors, writers, producers and directors.&#xD; [3067] SelaSys Incorporated are one of the oldest and most experienced JumpShip manufacturers in the Free Worlds, its pedigree dating back to before the first Star League, making it a natural partner in the FWLM�s WarShip program. The company was hired to bring back into service a number of mothballed vessels, most notably the FWLS Neuva Badajoz (hull CH4, the former SLS Impetuous). SelaSys also plays a significant role as a component supplier for Technicron and Illium, and was instrumental in the design of the Impavido-class vessel (manufactured at Technicron). &#xD; The corporation�s involvement in the League�s first WarShip project allowed it to install its own candidate, the CEO�s cousin, Ian, as the first vessel�s initial commander. An undistinguished naval officer, the now-retired Commodore Ian Deakin brought little to his command role, but his experiences serves SelaSys well � SelaSys has employed him as a consultant on the Venturer-class light cruiser currently under development; the first new WarShip class to be constructed at the yards. &#xD; Like many of its naval engineering peers, SelaSys also manufactures BattleMechs, having acquired Ronin, Inc. in 3016. One of several companies stripped from supporters of Anton Marik after his brief rebellion, Ronin is little more than an assembly facility for designs developed elsewhere. The simmering industrial disputes on Wallis have so far limited the company�s ability to compete in the wider market, resulting in little innovation, though its production capacity has increased substantially over the past two decades. That appears to be changing, however, as Ronin recently opened a new light Gauss rifle plant and has petitioned for a license to produce a new Warhammer variant.</Description>

With the collapse of the Terran war effort, a small reserve contingent, the 151st Altairian Fusiliers replaced the regulars, who rotated home. In 2244, the Fusiliers were still on Lucianca when Hector Worthington Rowe and his band began looking to settle a score. &#xD; Rowe was a veteran of the Outer Reaches Rebellion on Alexandria. Like so many veterans of past wars, Rowe could not adjust to the broken remnants of his post-war existence, his experiences having completely changed the former student's perspective on life. Rowe and many of his embittered fellow Alexandrians were searching for a way to pay back the Alliance for the destruction visited on their homeland. In 2239, Rowe formed a quasi-political club to instill Alexandrians with a rabid patriotism and a profound hatred of the Alliance. It was not long before this club became a paramilitary force seeking to strike at the �Great Alliance Devil.�&#xD; After learning of the presence of the nearby Fusiliers on Lucianca, Rowe recruited a band of Alexandrians, the Theban Legion, to cleanse the Outer Reaches of the last vestiges of Alliance �barbarism.� On July 7, 2244, Rowe and his 500 followers commandeered several JumpShips, forcing the captains to chart a course for Lucianca.&#xD; Disguised as a long-awaited relief convoy, Rowe's freebooters slipped past the Fusilier defenses, taking the troops completely by surprise. After personally executing the garrison commander and his executive officer, Rowe set up kangaroo courts, which condemned the surviving soldiers to death by slow torture for their actions as "war criminals". Over half the garrisons soldiers were brutally murdered before one of the JumpShip captains managed to jump out of the system.&#xD; Realizing that he and his followers would now be hunted down mercilessly, Rowe decided against returning to Alexandria. After giving the remaining merchantmen the option of making their fortunes beyond the stars or dying with the remainder of the Lucianca garrison, Rowe stripped the garrison of its weapons and stores and jumped into the unknown. First, however, he watched the last of the Fusiliers burn at the stake. Eventually passing through the Dark Nebula, Rowe discovered a small G5 star with a single habitable world orbiting it. He named the new world Apollo, and officially proclaimed the Rim Worlds Republic on September 8,2250.</Description>

Though no one has verified the veracity of these claims, the fact remains that well over half the textbooks in Lyran schools�from elementary school through the college level�feature material researched and verified by Dobless.&#xD; Unfortunately, the recent seizure of the company�s former headquarters on Chahar by Jade Falcon forces has cut off the company from its largest data node and forced CEO Seth Tobiason to relocate to the city of Bayern on Ludwigshafen. Since then, Tobiason has suggested to his shareholders that Dobless may soon commission a mercenary expedition to Chahar to liberate the larger archives said to be buried deep beneath the captured company headquarters complex.</Description>

Jumpships arrived insystem about every month, but that was the extent of its relations with other worlds.  All the farmers wanted was to be left alone.  Sanethia Kurita's proclamation establishing the new capital of the Draconis Combine on Luthien brought heated protests from the farmers, but the Coordinator's word was law.  Dropships of technicians, engineers, architects, and construction workers began arriving in the Luthien system daily, and the Combine confiscated the land chosen for the Imperial City.  The Coordinator did, however, arrange the evacuation of the farmers to the unsettled though habitable world of Yumesta.  Luthien was to be an industrialized world and had no need for farmlands.  Luthien was industrialized quickly.  Drawn by the profits to be made, companies began buying up the land from the Combine.  Soon, most of the surface was turned into factories.  Although the planet contained no raw materials, the world became an important source of manufactured goods.  Even today, Luthien is a major manufacturing world.  Imperial City on Luthien is one of the most breathtaking cities in the Inner Sphere.

Both Jaguar Trinaries walked into a well-orchestrated crossfire in Topeka Bay. &#xD; Unfortunately for the Ninth, the Clan forces managed to force their way out of the firing zone and circle behind the Ninth. The Regulars fled north, taking heavy casualties. When they arrived at Lawrence Pass, the route through the last mountain range that separated them from Luzerne's capital city and spaceport, the Smoke Jaguars fired down on the Ninth from the walls of the pass and virtually destroyed the unit.&#xD; [3055] On July 7 3055, the DCMS and Explorer Corps staged a daring raid against the Smoke Jaguar command post on Luzerne. The outcome of this raid added considerably to the Inner Sphere's knowledge of Clan equipment, particularly of their naval vessels.&#xD; [3059] Though the world of Luzerne boosted few resources and virtually no military industry, the world became the site of one of the stiffest challenges the SLDF faced during the entirety of Operation Bulldog. A disastrous approach resulted in a WarShip battle, and only half of the assault force made it to the planet's surface. Expecting to meet the 4th Provisional Garrison Cluster, the SLDF force found itself facing the newly formed front-line Sixth Striker Cluster as well. The Jaguars scattered the SLDF units across the face of the planet, and within hours it seemed that Luzerne would become the final graveyard for the Third Davion Guards RCT and ComStar's 208th Division. &#xD; One of three SLDF bastions during the five-week battle for Luzerne, the town of Th�n became a focus for many SLDF forces on the planet. Survivors of both the Davion Guards and Com Guard Division formed an ad-hoc combined-arms force approximately two battalions strong. Perhaps the strongest ally of the SLDF unit was the nature of the Jaguar foe it faced. As a front-line unit, the Sixth Striker. Assumed command, but they were both new to the world and incomplete as a unit. While not much of an obstacle to the hunter-killer missions staged against the stragglers, these handicaps proved a major hindrance when planning assaults on the SLDF strongholds.&#xD; The battle for Th�n was bloody for both sides, with neither force holding a decisive advantage. A handful of Clan 'Mechs broke through the perimeter, causing considerable damage to the heart of the town, but that damage was minor compared to the outskirts, where the battle raged for hours. In the end, the Jaguars withdrew and the two sides settled into a siege pattern, broken by occasional raids. It took the arrival of the Ryuken-Roku on the 1st August to break the cycle and tilt the advantage decisively in favor of the SLDF.</Description>

    <Description>Lyons was a modest world when first discovered, with ample resources but few features that truly stood out among the hundreds of worlds being colonized at the time. Warm, with a very terrestrial climate, fertile soil, and a host of common metals within easy reach of mining interests, only the unusually high amount of volcanic activity, particularly along the central mountain ranges of the primary continent of Fedkirk, makes the world distinctive. &#xD; To avoid the worst of the chronic eruptions and lava flows of the so-called Fedkirk Fire Chain, settlements on Fedkirk were established on the farthest coasts, leaving much of the interior region unspoiled and sparsely populated. Additional cities grew up on the smaller continents of Glastone, Leuben, and Pairse, including the planetary capital of Davids' Point, which occupies the end of Glastone's northernmost peninsula. With mining and manufacturing concerns limited in scope, Lyons developed only a modest commercial industry, but enough to attain self-sufficiency in short order.&#xD; When the Terran Alliance fell, the people of Lyons hardly felt the loss until the Terran Hegemony rose in its place and annexed the planet with ease. The Lyran Commonwealth, however, took an active interest in Lyons as a potential center for trade, and negotiated with the Hegemony for joint administration during the Star League era. Unfortunately, with the fall of the League, Lyons's prominence seemed to come to an end.&#xD; In the Succession Wars that followed, the world was raided several times, as might be expected for a Lyran/Draconis border planet, but a dedicated aerospace defense force based on its single moon often discouraged the casual raiding force. After the Succession Wars, Lyons rose in stature again as the lynchpin world of the so-called Lyons Thumb, a region of Lyran-occupied space extending into the Draconis Combine that remained under constant threat from House Kurita for decades.&#xD; Unfortunately, the rise of the Free Skye movement hindered defensive operations, and some experts say contributed to the planet's eventual fall to the Combine at the onset of the FedCom Civil War. Remarkably, Lyons came through all the collective fighting of the Star League's fall, the Succession Wars, and even the FedCom Civil War with minimal damage.</Description>

    <Description>[3067] Able to trace its origins back to 20th century Terra, Apple Computers Interstellar (ACI) is one of the longest-surviving companies in the entire Inner Sphere. For the first half of its life, it existed by producing computers for a more or less niche market, but during the Star League era the company grew into a truly interstellar industrial power, thanks to a succession of League government contracts. The fall of the Star League and the Succession Wars that followed nearly destroyed the company, though. All but one of its factories were destroyed, and it subsisted for years primarily by servicing the machines they had sold the Star League government � systems which proved largely incompatible with the bulk of the computers in service through the rest of the Inner Sphere � and by utilizing the tax base of the company�s wholly-owned base world of Macintosh (formerly known as Drekos).&#xD; Ultimately, the company diversified, debuting a number of computer and software lines that allowed the company to rebound and gain a lasting reputation for foresight and innovation. Most of its high-tech empire is based on Macintosh - with its headquarters based in the city of New Delos -  but ACI has additional manufacturing facilities on a number of other worlds, including New Avalon, Donegal, Irian, and Grumium (several other factories were overrun during the Clan invasion and now produce computers for Clans Wolf and Jade Falcon). Its greatest business comes from industrial and government sales, but it also accounts for a not-insignificant percentage of personal computer sales across the Inner Sphere.</Description>

    <Description>[3051] Clan Wolf landed on Maestu in November 3051. Galaxy Commander Mikel Fury's opponent on Maestu was Hauptman General Jane Cragie, a leader almost as flamboyant and eccentric as the Wolf commander. It proved to be a campaign of derring-do and great drama, reflecting the personalities of the two commanders. The 'Mechs and Elementals of Gamma Galaxy made a daring and difficult drop through a storm of Lyran fighters just kilometers from the First Lyran Guards RCT's defensive positions. On landing, Galaxy Commander Furey released a Star of headhunters who slipped through the left flank of the Lyrans and found General Cragie's HQ. The ensuing fight in and around the HQ building was fierce, but General Cragie and her command staff were not hurt. Gamma Galaxy launched a simultaneous offensive that broke through the general's lines in several places before she could regain command of the situation.&#xD; The First Lyrans went of the defensive, retreating toward New Yoko, Maestu's capital. At Cold Harbor, the First Lyrans were cut off from New Yoko. General Cragie determined that her situation was unsalvageable and ordered her troops to retreat offworld to Shaula. She was following the orders issued by the Davion High Command stressing that it was better to run, and live to fight another day, than fight to the last warrior for a planet already lost.</Description>

    <Description>[2580] During the Reunification War, after months of a fairly cautious campaign, General Wexworth advanced into the Pleiades Cluster with the Star League's 4th Corps under his personal command. As expected, the Taurian defense was fierce, and the two sides fought a three-day naval duel that destroyed 13 Taurian and 15 League ships.&#xD; Having disposed of the Taurian navy guarding the Pleiades, albeit at heavy cost, the 4th Corps began simultaneous landings against the industrial worlds of the cluster during May 2580. In every case, the scenario was the same. After an uncontested landing, the troops would barely have time to form up before wave after wave of Concordat Regulars, seeming to have come from nowhere, began to assault the League BattleMechs with any means at their disposal.&#xD; After repulsing the initial counterattacks, the Forth found things tougher going as it entered the Taurian urban centers. On Maia, women and children lined the thoroughfares leading to the planet's capital, blocking the advancing 28th Diomede Regulars while a savage artillery barrage rained down on the confused attackers.&#xD; When the Cluster was finally pacified in September 2580, the 4th Corps effective strength had been reduced by 40%.&#xD; [3066] Expecting a Davion invasion of the Taurian Concordat which never came, the now paranoid Protector Shraplen ordered his own strikes deep into the Federated Suns. At first his regiments made remarkable progress, having attacked a region of space where the AFFS had few resources remaining - most being tied up in the ongoing civil war. These successes prompted further strikes with the Taurian regiments now believing they could reclaim their ancient homeworlds, and pay the Federated Suns back for their losses in the Reunification Wars. &#xD; By early 3067 however, and with the civil war coming to an end, Duke George Hasek was able to send a massive force of AFFS regulars and mercenary units to cut the Taurians off and repel them. By March of 3067 the Federated Suns had retaken and pacified every world except the Cluster worlds, leaving the Concordat with slippery footholds on these remaining planets.&#xD; Protector Shraplen is determined to keep a foothold within the Cluster, and believes resistance has to last until the upcoming Star League conference. There, Taurian grievances can finally be addressed and, with House Liao's backing, the Protector will push for nothing less than the proper return of the Pleiades Cluster to Taurian rule.</Description>

    <Description>During the early years of the Star League, the economy of the Lyran Commonwealth entered an unparalleled period of growth. While good for propaganda, prosperity had not been spread around equally among Lyran worlds, which brought to a head a problem that had been festering for many years.&#xD; The Federation of Skye and the Tamar Pact, the industrial giants of the Star League, were making huge sums of money per world, while the Protectorate of Donegal had actually experienced a drop in profits per planet. Yet, according to the tax system, each province was expected to pay a third of the taxes needed to finance the commonwealth government. This left the Protectorate poorer, whilst the other two barely missed their shares.&#xD; This imbalance eventually led to a growing movement among poorer worlds of the Periphery provinces for substantial tax reform. This movement became known as the Main Street Rebellion, named for the Periphery world where the issue first arose in 2574. The Rebellion soon had hundreds of thousands of supporters, and clashes with their opponents were often violent.&#xD; This placed Archon Viola Steiner-Dinesen in a delicate position. As ruler of the Commonwealth, she was duty-bound to suppress any danger to the realm, yet as leader of the Protectorate of Donegal, she also had to agree with much of what The Main Street Rebellion had to say.&#xD; After a bit of political wrangling, the Archon persuaded the Duke of Skye, the leader of the rich-worlds coalition, to agree to publicly debate the issue before the Estates General. After the debate the Representatives would vote on whether to change the tax system, and the Archon and Duke of Skye would honor the decision. After five hours of debating in the stuffy throne room where the Representatives had gathered to listen, the vote was cast almost unanimously in favor of the Archon's desire to change the tax system.</Description>

Two Trinaries of the 89th pursued the fleeing troops back into the city, where the planetary administrator surrendered the world with no further resistance.&#xD; Derided by both Clansmen and Inner Sphere military personnel as a coward, the administrator chose to save his people from being slaughtered by an invincible enemy.

    <Description>Early in the period known as the Exodus, Mallory's World was discovered and immediately colonized by European and English immigrants. Despite being one of House Davion's most agriculturally rich planets, Mallory's World is usually better known as a waystation for invasion forces.  The first colonists were shocked to find that the host of vicious parasites rampant among the planet's lushness were the carriers of numerous strange diseases. Dr. Beck Mallory was a second- rate parasitologist who had joined the colonists to escape a failed career on Terra. When his fellow colonists consulted him about the parasite problem, Dr. Mallory's first reaction was the desire to flee such responsibility. Gentle and not-so-gentle persuasion eventually convinced him to attempt to discover a solution. Mallory probably amazed no one so much as himself when he discovered a common link among all the native parasites, to which a simple vitamin complex shot would provide immunity. In gratitude, the colonists named their world after Mallory.  They quickly turned the planet into a garden spot, whose surplus food fed many less-fortunate nearby worlds. This might have been a happy world had it not been for the many occupations by repressive Combine or Capellan regimes. Despite the frequent fighting, Mallory's World survived the Age of War and eventually became a member of the Federated Suns. During the Star League era, the people of Mallory's World were able to use the new technologies coming out of the Terran member-state to further boost the yield of their crops and herd animals.  The collapse of the League and outbreak of the Succession Wars would change all that. The First War left the planet, its population, and the majority of the planet's agricultural centers seriously damaged. The second war, though less violent, did even more harm. The strategic location of Mallory's World between the Draconis Combine and the Capellan Confederation made it such a tempting target that those two realms were frequent and brutal in their attacks. The Federated Suns, not willing to part with such a strategically vital world, heavily defended Mallory's World.  By the beginning of the Third Succession War, three of the four continents on Mallory's World have been so trampled that little will ever grow there again. In recent years, the fourth continent has been declared off-limits by the Davion government so that it can eventually begin producing food. Even the Capellans and the Kuritans have decided to respect this liberated zone.  The planet's capital is Mallory City, located on the Northern Oregon continent. Not far from the capital city is Fort Dodger, the headquarters of the planet's BattleMech contingent. &#xD; House Davion recaptured Mallory's World twelve years ago in 3013, but the price of victory was the life of Prince Ian Davion, as well as several thousand soldiers. Since that time, the garrison has fought off several sustained assaults by crack Kuritan regiments.</Description>

When the Bears entered the mine, the mercenaries triggered the explosives, and rejoiced in apparent victory - prematurely. &#xD; Unknown to The GoldMiners, a Star League base had been built beneath and behind the mine shafts, the 72nd, overhearing the mercenaries pan via an intercepted transmission, had sent the First Elementals Support Binary ahead of the 'Mechs to open the doors to the base's tunnel network. Just before the explosives went off, the 72nd slipped through the hidden entrances to the Star League base.

Since the beginning of this period of planetary upheaval. over 20 percent of the population has left Manteno and about 10 percent of the businesses have relocated.  Manteno was not always shaking or threatening to explode. At one time, geologists of the Terran Alliance considered it to be both a stable world and one rich in large and accessible deposits of metals and chemical compounds. The planet was colonized and immediately became an important part of the Federated Suns economy. Manteno's first major setback in the First Succession War came when the Draconis Combine attacked, destroying most of the planet's industries. Manteno was just regaining its industrial might at the time that the current phase of convulsions began.

The majority of Mara's settlements are concentrated inland of the Great Rim area, near these logging operations, in a temperate region of plains and large lakes that in many ways resembles the climate of Terra's European-Mediterranean region.&#xD; The planetary capital city of Terrace is located on the northern Broomstick Plains, roughly 40 kilometers inland of the Great Rim, near the smaller coastal city of Mountlake, which is itself home to Hara-Maku Enterprises, owners of Mara's largest commercial fishing fleet. Hara-Maku's operations focus mainly on harvesting the famed fresh-water Mara Trout. These delicate fish are difficult to breed elsewhere within the Inner Sphere, though are found in abundance in many of Appilagio's inland seas, lakes, and rivers. Their harvesting accounts for most of the planet's secondary food-export industry. The spaceport city of Lockholme, located in the southern peninsula of Appilagio, is also home to the Mara Development Corporation, a construction equipment company that specializes in the manufacture of many industrial 'Mech designs.</Description>

Originally part of the Terran Hegemony, where its industries boomed and the planet even became the site for Orguss Industries, a prominent Star League-era BattleMech manufacturer, this world suffered during the Amaris crisis. &#xD; The Usurper�s troops, seeking to augment their nuclear and BattleMech arsenals, forced much of the population to work on expanding the uranium mines throughout Wahryn, its southern continent, and enforced a tripled production rate at the BattleMech plant. This was sustained for over five years of occupation, and by the time of the liberation over three million natives of Marcus had died in the mines and factory plants. &#xD; The fall of the Star League left the world with little hope of recovery until the Free Worlds League claimed it, but as an industrial border world, Marcus became the target for raids and invasions launched by the nearby House Steiner. The Orguss plants and many of the supporting industries were left devastated by centuries of raids and invasion attempts, devastating the planetary economy and infrastructure.&#xD; By the closing years of the thirtieth century, this endless decline had spawned a worldwide attitude of apathy, and the locals viewed war and death as little more than a logical outcome of their existence. By 3016 this sense of nihilism had achieved the point where a new cult � the Way of Arme, which teaches its followers that solace may be found in one�s �Culmination,� or suicide � had formed around it. This suicide cult created a brief stir throughout the League and nearby Lyran worlds, but attrition among its membership virtually assured its quick passing.&#xD; During the Fourth Succession War, Marcus briefly changed hands, becoming a protectorate of the Federated Commonwealth, but was reclaimed by House Marik during the Marik-Liao invasion of 3057, after a particularly brutal battle.&#xD; The capital city of Zotikos stands on the northern continent of Montezumia, and is host to the planet�s primary spaceport.</Description>

Its many regions of warm temperatures, rich soil, and gentle climates have produced a vast array of forests and jungles. Many of Marduk's plant and animal forms were valuable for export while most of the numerous colonists worked as farmers and ranchers.&#xD; Just prior to the creation of the Star League, a deposit of rare metals was discovered in the center of the Tillerbee Jungle. To exploit the discovery, a huge complex of factories was built directly over the metals deposit. After the     ore has been mined it is processed in a smelter system next to the factory. The finished product travels less than a hundred meters before being turned into Griffin and Wolverine chassis. Other nearby factories make almost all the electronic and mechanical components necessary to build the 'Mechs. Only the tracking system must be imported from offworld. This complex of factories was built with such skill that it barely damaged the surrounding jungle Finished 'Mechs were lifted off Marduk from the spaceport built nearby.&#xD; As the Norse BattleMech Works is one of the few nearly self-reliant 'Mech factories in the Inner Sphere, it was one of the initial targets of the First Succession War. With the factory complex nestled deep in the huge, swampy jungle, it has proved to be a formidable target. Since then, the complex has been attacked at least twelve times. Though it has fallen briefly to the Draconis Combine on two separate occasions, the planet has been providing BattleMechs for the Federated Suns almost without interruption.&#xD; The capital city of Marduk is New Pontiac, the urban center closest to the Norse BattleMech works.</Description>

    <Description>Though it orbits far from its white-hot parent star, summers on Marfik are hot indeed. Part of this oppressive climate is due, of course, to the thin atmosphere, and nearly nonexistent ozone layer, which fails to protect this planet adequately against harmful solar radiation and cosmic rays. For this reason, early settlers quickly established most of their colonies below ground, or under protective domes. Though native flora already existed, imported plants were also introduced in an effort to thicken and purify the air, supplemented by atmospheric processors built later on. &#xD; Unfortunately, the constant fighting for this border world, which boasts veins of valuable metals, including germanium and titanium, set back such efforts again and again through the centuries. Nevertheless, in the Star League era, terraforming efforts had begun to bear fruit, allowing the people of this world to step outside without the aid of filter masks or thick sunscreens.&#xD; Unfortunately, the loss of the Star League-era atmospheric purifiers during the early years of the Succession Wars initiated a gradual downward spiral as the planet reverts to its native atmosphere.&#xD; The planetary capital city and largest spaceport, Turkestgard, is located on the northern continent of Yantiban. Secondary spaceports may also be found in Kirikut and Halifax, the largest cities on the continents North Galfree and South Galfree, respectively.</Description>

    <Description>First settled by Terran Alliance ships in 2139, this metal-rich planet evolved into the cornerstone of the financial empire that would become the Marik Commonwealth. Today, with its most lucrative mineral deposits mined out, it serves as the symbolic seat of the Marik's power and the site of the Captain-General's winter residence.&#xD; Marik is a Terran-sized planet, with a gravity slightly higher than Terran normal and a hot, dry climate. During the height of its summer, devastating duststorms and tornadoes are common. Consequently, both the royal palace at Dormuth and the LCCC headquarters complex outside Malkent are stark, sprawling facilities that possess little of the majesty one expects to find in a major public edifice.&#xD; Between the Captain-General, the LCCC, and Imstar Aerospace's fighter production facility in Cugyar, the planet recieves many military visitors. Many of the civilian travelers who arrive at Andrew Marik Memorial Spaceport come either to trade, prospect for firestones (a much-prized orange-red gemstone), or to compete in the Burlingrad Hoverdrome, where weekly individual and team speeder races are vidtape entertainment staples.</Description>

    <Description>Markab was settled in the early days of the 25th century by the Azami, a fanatical Muslim culture originating from the northern region of Terra's Africa continent, known for its fierce and dedicated warriors. Much of Markab strongly resembles the native lands of these proud people. The surface land of Markab is concentrated mostly in a single, giant supercontinent known as Al-Qoradana, which has few inland rivers or bodies of water of any sort. &#xD; A few islands of various sizes pepper the oceans surrounding this great landmass, but it is on Al-Qoradana that the settlers established the majority of their cities. These early colonists, drawn by the hidden wealth of precious metals and hydrocarbons beneath the windswept surface of sand, rocks, and preciously few oases, carved their niche into the world despite a harmful bacteriological taint in the atmosphere.&#xD; Resourceful, the Azami learned to overcome the ravages of the world's environment, and the planet flourished despite a campaign by the forces of the Draconis Combine to undercut their culture and independence. As a result of the Combine attacks, however, most of the Azami's water-purification plants were destroyed, and those that survived malfunctioned over time. Only in the last century or so, with the rediscovery of lost technologies, have the inhabitants of Markab been able to restore the lost ability to drink their own world's abundant seawater and use it for irrigation.</Description>

    <Description>The eighth of ten planets, Marshdale's orbit never took it close enough to either of the binary system's stars to warm up. However, the gravitational forces working on the planet squashed and stretched it regularly. This created enough friction between tectonic plates to warm the world's oceans sufficiently to sustain life, as well as creating the ground hugging clouds of fog that shroud the planet's six continents. The earthquakes produced as a by-product of this gravitational torture require that all buildings are massive constructions, but with tremors so common all long-time residents ignore all but the truly violent ones.&#xD; [3051] Clan Smoke Jaguar landed on Marshdale in November 3051. Reassigned to Marshdale in the year-long lull in the Clan invasion, the Sixth Ghost Regiment had set up a complicated series of defenses across Marshdale's smallest continent. The Sixth Ghost led the Third Cavaliers on a wild chase up and down the continent, snaring more than a few of the Clan 'Mechs in the more ingenious defenses and traps.&#xD; Tiring of the game, the Third's commander sent his heavy elements into the city of Drenden and ordered them to tear it up as a means of drawing the Sixth Ghost Regiment into open battle. The Sixth complied, meeting the Jaguars in Asquare Field where the troops had sown bombs and traps. Remembering their earlier experience, the Jaguars prudently sent members of the technician caste ahead of the Clan 'Mechs to trip the bombs in advance. The Cavaliers then cut a swath through to the Sixth Ghost. The Sixth made an orderly retreat to the city of Thoughnet, where the Cavaliers overtook and defeated them.&#xD; [3059] During Operation Bulldog, the Ryuken-Ni, the Com Guard's Ninth Division, and the First Fusiliers of Oriente assaulted Marshdale. The Alpha Galaxy Command Trinary and Ninth Jaguar Cavaliers fought with determination and refused to abandon the world. The Galaxy Command Trinary, operating as an elite tactical strike force, severely damaged the Fusiliers, and managed to decimate a full company of the Ryuken. But the Ninth Cavaliers could not stand up to the main force of the assault, and on August 12 the Clan unit began to collapse under the relentless pressure of the Ryuken-Ni and Ninth Com Guard Division.</Description>

On Matamoras, civilians valiantly helped the 1st Free Worlds Guards and 2nd Night Stalkers thwart the Nineteenth Striker Cluster�s offensive. Frustrated at every turn by civilian countermeasures, the Nineteenth was forced to group its units together for protection. Later, the Ryuken-Yon regiment staged a night-time combat drop into the Jaguar-controlled area and managed to break the Jaguars� back in a coordinated offensive movement with the two defending regiments.</Description>

    <Description>Despite good sun, good position, and good planet size, Matsuida somehow manages to be hideous. Rough terrain broken only by seas of gelatinous peagreen water helped earn this planet its nickname of "Nausea."&#xD; Matsuida is a prefecture capital as well as the headquarters of the 12th Galedon Regulars. Because of many generations of patient, nausea-proof sailors, a thriving fishing industry has developed that literally scoops up chunks of the ocean to get at the Matsuida Carp, considered a delicacy on distant Luthien.&#xD; [3059] At some point in its past, the Galedon Military academy (GMA) began to concentrate on physical strength and endurance as vital to a warrior's role. As a result, academy life grew progressively more brutal until training procedures had to be modified to prevent unnecessary deaths. Located on the inhospitable world of Matsuida, the GMA offers training in each branch of warfare. A high death rate among aerospace pilot trainees, however, may lead the academy to phase out its aerospace program over the next few years.&#xD; Only graduates of Galedon primary schools may enter the GMA, and all applicants must be in excellent physical condition. Academy recruiters conduct a battery of tests on several Galedon District worlds for potential candidates.&#xD; Basic training includes DCMS-required skills, as well as intense physical conditioning. Cadets may not take elective courses at this stage. Even with the modifications made in recent years, GMA basic training remains among the most brutal in the Draconis Combine; for example, instructors have been known to beat a cadet badly to "toughen him up." Female cadets generally receive more abuse than their male colleagues do, presumably because they need more hardening. Those cadets who survive basic training may then choose a particular military specialty - though they may also choose to take extra courses in unarmed combat or survival techniques. &#xD; In spite of the abuse and exhaustion - or perhaps because of it - GMA instructors instill strong loyalty to House Kurita and to the Galedon Military Academy in each cadet. In a blend of GMA training and Luthien court ritual, cadets use the phrase "my life for the Dragon" to mark time between push-ups or weightlifting. A poor performance reflects on a cadet's loyalty and is punished by the nearest instructor. Legend has it that one GMA graduate who prostrated himself before Takashi Kurita to receive the Order of the Dragon said "my life for the Dragon" for almost four hours before becoming hoarse.&#xD; GMA cadets graduate with little fanfare and go straight into the Second Galedon Regulars for two years. Those who prove themselves in combat often come back to the GMA as instructors.</Description>

As soon as the 433rd Supernova Trinary departed, leaving behind a Provisional Garrison Cluster, local people began staging round-the-clock protests at the Clan administrator's headquarters. &#xD; Realizing that they could not imprison everyone on Maule for "treasonous activities," the Ghost Bear authorities heeded the people's grievances and agreed to give the citizens a limited degree of freedom, even allowing them to travel under Clan supervision.&#xD; Because Maule is currently one of the few planets in Clan-held space that regularly trades with the Inner Sphere, the 304th Assault Cluster defends the world from the possibility of attack by Inner Sphere forces.&#xD; [3063] During the Combine / Ghost Bear War, the Bear�s 304th Assault Cluster was severely damaged during a brutal deep strike by the Nova Cats. Thanks to the Bears actions on Yamarovka and Mualang, the Cats were no longer bound by zellbrigen and Delta Galaxy slammed into the 304th.

Surprisingly, though Federation President McIntyre knew an invasion of his nation was inevitable, none found out about the secret base on Valerius until III Legio dropped onto Maximillian in January 3066. &#xD; Caesar Julius O'Reilly had intended to use more forces for this first wave, but was forces to use additional resources to put down small insurrections and apparent Pirate raids throughout his realm. Nevertheless, the first invasion wave was brilliantly executed, and Maximillian fell in mere weeks. It didn't hurt that the Circinians saw the Marian invaders as liberators as much as conquerors.&#xD; With a second wave launching soon after, the Circinians retaliated with a rearguard attack on Maximillian with forces disguised as elements of IV Legio. Though suicidal attacks did little damage to the Marian military machine, they did tie up the Caesar's support units further, forcing them to return and secure the world.&#xD; Though a state of war still technically exists between the Marian Hegemony and the Circinus Federation - President McIntyre ordered the Caesar's diplomatic envoys returned to Alphard decapitated - the fighting has been over for more than a year.</Description>

Corruption is prevalent but despite attempts by the AFFC to �clean up� the Mayetta DMM, support for the Yalos family is too strong. &#xD; While Prince Victor was off fighting the Smoke Jaguars, rumor has it that Leftenant General Kirk Yalos set about establishing his own fief in the Draconis March. He engineered it so that his son, Jason, was rapidly promoted to command the militia, allowing him to retain influence in the unit while concentrating on political and economic matters.&#xD; The AFFC has considered disbanding the Militia but believe doing so would result in major casualties in the Mayetta DMM and any unit sent to enforce the order.&#xD; [3063] During the Civil War, Leftenant General Jason Yalos decided to side with the Allied forces, despite the fact that he and his unit had expressed their fanatical support for Katherine Steiner-Davion after her ascension to power. Yalos went as far as detaining Marshal Vonda DeGreer and her PDZ command staff, all apparent supporters of the Archon. Recognizing not only the value of Mayetta, but also the fact that it would likely become a target for the Archon�s forces, Baron Tancred Sandoval immediately led his Allied forces to Mayetta.&#xD; When he arrived on March 7 3063, he discovered that elements of the Bremond and Milligan DMMs had taken it upon themselves to hit Mayetta in concert, hoping to crush Yalos and his forces. While the Loyalist units had only been on-world or a few days, Yalos had already given up a third of the world to the invaders and had suffered heavy casualties and losses due to capture and desertion.&#xD; Over the course of a month of heavy fighting, the Allied forces inflicted heavy casualties on the opposing DMMs, though were likewise losing fighting strength in every battle. While he could keep the Loyalist DMM�s tied up for months, Baron Sandoval knew there were more important targets within the Federated Suns that his Allied troops could potentially take and hold - Sandoval force�s left Mayetta on the 14th April. &#xD; General Yalos� Mayetta DMM held for another 2 weeks prior to crushed in a four hour battle for Raabel Pass, one of just three thoroughfares through the Ren Kalen Mountains, standing to the southwest of the Goran Moraines and the Tuskange Depression.&#xD; General Samprini, commander of the loyalist force, took Yalos prisoner at the end of the fight. General Yalos stood trial for crimes against the Federated Commonwealth and for the murder of Marshal DeGreer and two dozen of her senior officers � executed in the week following Baron Sandoval�s retreat � and was himself imprisoned until the end of the Civil War.</Description>

    <Description>[3039] Unlike many of the other worlds struck by mercenaries in the opening shots of the War of 3039, McComb proved to be quite a challenge, especially considering the rabid anti-Combine movement that had long been present. On the other hand, it was precisely because of that movement that the DCMS assigned regular army infantry and armor forces to garrison the planet. &#xD; The Combine defenders were at a disadvantage, however. After a decade of fending off highly-organized terrorist attacks, they were specialists in urban policing and rooting out small groups of heavily-armed fighters from wilderness hideouts. While they were prepared for a coordinated attack in three dozen cities across the planet by rebel groups, they were wholly unprepared to deal with the battalion of Martian Cuirassiers BattleMechs assigned to the world. Military bases at Goundam and Kati�i fell quickly to just two lances of �Mechs each, supported of course by masses of freedom fighters. Likewise, freedom fighters secured the capital of Makorou with little effort.&#xD; After the first few days, however, the DCMS forces were able to organize themselves to put up a concerted fight. Their forces were still scattered across the world, but neither side had the obvious upper hand�the skies were still almost uncontested, and unless the mercenaries could place a company of �Mechs in a position to contest, the DCMS could still defeat any serious threat the freedom fighters posed to them.&#xD; As a result, the fight for McComb turned into a struggle of brinksmanship, with some cities changing hands a dozen times in the first two months. The mercenaries deployed themselves so that a company of striker �Mechs, supported by a handful of special forces troops and two rag-tag battalions of motorized infantry, were always in the field. Though this was taxing, it kept the pressure on the Combine defenders, and the AFFS-supported freedom fighters began to slowly gain ground. The DCMS troops twice attempted daring maneuvers that could have dealt a serious blow to the attackers, but ultimately found out that even light and medium �Mechs outclassed what armor they could put into the field. Thereafter, they fought a conservative defense, confident the DCMS would eventually send them reinforcements.&#xD; Tensions remained high on McComb throughout the third quarter of 3039, and well into the fourth quarter. A significant portion of the world�s population, as well as the remnants of its Combine-trained militia, continued to be a thorn in the side of the Martian Cuirassiers and the insurgent forces they were supporting. The Combine supporters held the advantage in manpower, but the mercenaries fielded the only BattleMechs left on the world and thus held the edge.&#xD; It still took almost six months of intensive operations to put an end to most of the militant pro-Combine activity on the world, however. During that time, the mercenaries found themselves not only under the cloud of fighting a conventional war against a guerrilla opponent but also facing the threat of counterattack. Starting in August, they began to receive some additional assistance from Robinson in the form of supplies and civilian relief and assistance workers, which went quite a long way toward winning over the world�s population. &#xD; It wasn�t until the special forces team assigned to McComb captured the recognized heads of the pro-Combine underground in October, however, that the frequency and intensity of the guerrilla strikes truly decreased. By December, the chief Civil Assistance Advisor, the head FedSuns bureaucrat detailed to the world, declared McComb pacified and began the process of officially bringing the world into the Federated Suns. The mercenaries remained on the world for another two years, however, assisting the planet�s new military governor in destroying the remaining pro-Combine rebel cells and training the planet�s militia.</Description>

McRae then offered to rebuild the damage infrastructure, charging outrageous prices by padding its invoices. When the scandal broke, McRae�s share prices bombed allowing the company to be acquired by the Green Star Corporation, at only a fraction of its worth.</Description>

    <Description>[2578] Although the victory off Vakarel boosted Canopian morale, the war would soon have been over for them had it not been for the action of Colonel Adam Buquoy. Buquoy was a die-hard military man, one of several professional soldiers that the Magestrix had hired to lead her troops. Ever since the broadcast of the Pollux Proclamation, Buquoy had spent his time planning and preparing contingencies for the day when he would have to face the might of the Star League military machine. Noting the League's dependence on high-tech equipment and the Marik's long supply lines, Buquoy decided to launch a surprise attack against the supply nexus on Meadowvale.&#xD; Using the Canopian navy to slip behind Star League lines, Buquoy attacked Meadowvale in the early morning of January 9, 2578. Assaulting the supply depot was Buquoy's own Bandits, supported by the mercenary regiments of Samualson's Slaughterers, Kincani's Dragoons, and Miselsen's Marauders - nine battalions of 'Mechs and infantry in all. Though well conceived, Buquoy's mission failed to achieve surprise, for the crew at Meadowvale's Jump Point managed to alert the planet's garrison before being overwhelmed by Buquoy's force.&#xD; His presence compromised, Buquoy determined to press home the attack anyway. Finding the 15th Terran Armored Division opposing his landings and threatened by approaching BattleMech reinforcements, he dispersed his units to strike at neighboring supply depots. Buquoy's Bandits waged a desperate five-hour holding action until the other mercenary units reported that the depots had been destroyed. Then, the mercenaries (minus most of Buquoy's Bandits) retreated offworld.&#xD; The surprise attack on Meadowvale altered the shape of the Marik's campaign. After six months of constructing new supply and operation bases in regular intervals along her supply line, Marion Marik resumed the offensive late in 2578.</Description>

As part of a Falcon move to secure the worlds surrounding Melissia, the First Falcon Striker and Eighth Talon Clusters landed on Medellin on the 23rd November 3064.&#xD; Having been badly mauled by various Falcon units throughout the Incursion, the militia lost cohesion a day into the battle, giving the Falcons the chance to pick off scattered companies and battalions at leisure. Colonel Mason was able to get a handle on her militia two days later, organizing them enough to pull off a fighting retreat. The unit left the system on the 27th November, heading for the relative safety of the Lyran Alliance�s interior.&#xD; In the tenth and final wave of the counterattack, the Fifteenth Lyran Regulars followed their quick victory on Adelaide with an assault on Medellin, where the Pryde Eyrie Cluster had been stationed. Landing on the 5th of June 3065, the Regulars made short work of the Falcons, with the assistance of two armored regiments that General Steiner had managed to put together. Colonel Orsini declared victory on the 17th June, having driven the surviving four binaries of the Eyrie Cluster off world.</Description>

On Meinacos, the Jaguar's 267th Battle Cluster struck with enormous force, but the Eighth Dieron Regulars, St. Ives Cheveau Legers, and the First Canopian Cuirassiers engaged the Jaguar's in a deadly dance as both sides fought for dominance. The Eleventh Alshain Avengers, on their way to the planet Marshdale, were diverted to Meinacos to bolster the world's defenders. The Seventh Pesht Regulars were also called in from Unity, but arrived too late to affect the final outcome.&#xD; As the Eighth Dieron spearheaded a drive against the Jaguar unit's flank, the officer core of the Eleventh Alshain engaged and lured away two Stars of the Battle Cluster. The Canopian Cuirassiers managed to cut off a Clan retreat, then readied themselves to saturate the area with artillery. When the Eleventh Alshain failed to retreat as planned, the Cuirassiers sent a 'Mech company forward, supported by artillery, to aid the Avengers.&#xD; The Eleventh acquitted themselves with honor, their ferocity and tenacity shining testaments to the Dragon's will in action. All eight Alshain warriors died in the battle, but managed to destroy a full Star of Clan OmniMechs first.&#xD; The First Canopian Cuirassiers, despite their lack of technological upgrades, fought with nearly equal skill. They moved forward in full strength, engaging the Jaguars three-on-one when possible. The long-range hitting power of the Clan 'Mechs hurt them at first, but as soon as they closed sufficiently they switched to six-on-one odds and quickly brought down several Jaguar 'Mechs. The Cuirassiers' artillery accounted for one of the Clan Masakaris, hitting it dead-on.&#xD; With two fresh battalions of the Cuirassiers threatening the Clan flank and heavy pressure from the forefront of the battle, Star Colonel Diane Perez pulled her forces back to a mountainous area to regroup. At about the same time, the recall order for all Jaguar forces sounded, and the 267th retreated to their DropShips and left Meinacos without another major engagement.</Description>

The northern expanses of the continent are covered in ice. Beneath this ice is Melissia�s main export, Titanium. The southern part of the continent is mostly jungle.

    <Description>Many of the locals on Menkent refer to their world as the burial site of the Marsden dynasty, thanks to the heroic death of the Lyran Commonwealth�s second Archon, Alistair Marsden, on the Plain of Dust just outside the capital city of Blackstone in 2408. Marsden, who died leading a tank regiment during the Age of War, left behind his widow, Katherine Marsden-Steiner, the woman who would rule the Commonwealth and establish the Great House of Steiner. This simple historical event at once turned the sandy, sun-blasted world of Menkent into a tourist attraction for those willing to brave its closeness to the Draconis Combine border. &#xD; Lit by a large, orange subgiant, which it orbits just a little too closely, Menkent itself is a warm planet, less than half of which is covered by water, and that is so salty that it requires purifiers to drink. Even inland seas and rivers require treatment before they can be used for drinking and irrigation, making life here difficult, but not impossible. At the time of Marsden�s death, House Kurita had managed to overtake this world, and it would trade hands between Steiner and Kurita many times before and after the days of the original Star League. Effectively little more than a barren wasteland � its principal exports being limited to common metals and small machines � Menkent�s local infrastructure was ravaged by the centuries of continuous warfare. &#xD; The capital city of Blackstone stands at the junction of three rivers on Terrasota, the largest and most populous of the planet�s three continents. The other two continents, Areseppi and Aphirojia, are both equatorial continents, where the arid climate and local dust storms have made habitation more difficult than normal, and thus both are far less densely populated.</Description>

    <Description>[2580] During the Reunification War, after months of a fairly cautious campaign, General Wexworth advanced into the Pleiades Cluster with the Star League's 4th Corps under his personal command. As expected, the Taurian defense was fierce, and the two sides fought a three-day naval duel that destroyed 13 Taurian and 15 League ships.&#xD; Having disposed of the Taurian navy guarding the Pleiades, albeit at heavy cost, the 4th Corps began simultaneous landings against the industrial worlds of the cluster during May 2580. In every case, including that of Merope, the scenario was the same. After an uncontested landing, the troops would barely have time to form up before wave after wave of Concordat Regulars, seeming to have come from nowhere, began to assault the League BattleMechs with any means at their disposal.&#xD; When the Cluster was finally pacified in September 2580, the 4th Corps effective strength had been reduced by 40%.&#xD; Many stories and observations have accumulated over the years, which have made scholar's wonder what really happened to the SLDF. The disappearance of the Clinton Cutthroats, the Minnesota Tribe, and the Vandenberg White Wings are such incidents.&#xD; The Disappearing Battleship of Merope is another such story, regarding a Black Lion class WarShip that was seen and filmed orbiting Merope, but then vanished when ships from the Federated Suns came to investigate.&#xD; It is uncertain whether these stories are the wishful thinking of men and women tired of the conflict of the Succession Wars, or whether they are factual sightings.&#xD; [3066] Expecting a Davion invasion of the Taurian Concordat which never came, the now paranoid Protector Shraplen ordered his own strikes deep into the Federated Suns. At first his regiments made remarkable progress, having attacked a region of space where the AFFS had few resources remaining - most being tied up in the ongoing civil war. These successes prompted further strikes with the Taurian regiments now believing they could reclaim their ancient homeworlds, and pay the Federated Suns back for their losses in the Reunification Wars. &#xD; By early 3067 however, and with the civil war coming to an end, Duke George Hasek was able to send a massive force of AFFS regulars and mercenary units to cut the Taurians off and repel them. By March of 3067 the Federated Suns had retaken and pacified every world except the Cluster worlds, leaving the Concordat with slippery footholds on these remaining planets.&#xD; Protector Shraplen is determined to keep a foothold within the Cluster, and believes resistance has to last until the upcoming Star League conference. There, Taurian grievances can finally be addressed and, with House Liao's backing, the Protector will push for nothing less than the proper return of the Pleiades Cluster to Taurian rule.</Description>

    <Description>The loss of this agricultural world specializing in the production of rare wines has been particularly disturbing to the luxury-minded Tikonov peoples.  Though the Succession Wars have destroyed much of the land give over to grape cultivation, a fair amount remains to serve the tables of House Davion, to the special annoyance of the Capellans.  Waldemar Teng, the prefect of Tikonov, has vowed to reconquer this one world specifically for its wines.  The leader of the planet, one of the most loyal Davion supporters, has vowed to pour the contents of his own wine cellar into the rivers that flow past the Presidential Palace if the Capellans ever do manage an invasion.</Description>

    <Description>First settled in 2530 by the Draconis Combine, the worlds of the Micanos system are drab and barren wastelands, perpetually covered with ice and snow and ravaged by fierce solar winds and occasional meteor showers. Three of the system's planets were rich with minerals and valuable ores, so despite the severe environmental conditions, the Combine quickly set up mining efforts on each, building a number of expensive environmental domes to support the worker populations. These domes, varying from eight to twenty per planet, are a legacy of the Star League at its technological finest, though are merely curiosities today. Profits from the mines quickly offset these costs and more than made up the price of operating such a remote operation.&#xD; The price for mining the system was measured in more than just money, though. Rather than pay the exorbitant cost of importing experienced miners, the combine populated the mining "camps" with political prisoners, protestors and other enemies of the state. Conservative estimates indicate that within the first decade well over half of the miners died. Of course, with nothing able to survive on the surface of these worlds and escape from the mines meaning certain death, work continued on. The mines continued to operate even during the Succession Wars. Its remote location and easily defendable facilities actually protected it while other similar colonies within the Inner Sphere fell.&#xD; As time passed, however, and the ore prices dropped, the Combine could not afford to keep the forced mining operation running indefinitely. Rather than spend years and untold fortunes in relocating the prisoners, the Draconis Combine simply pulled out and declared the Mican worlds independent. While other such prison worlds might have simply ceased to exist, the Mican worlds continued on and even prospered. The Mican prisoners on the whole were well educated and already had a well-established social order. Left to their own devices, they continued on and returned to mining the worlds. Trade convoys still used the huge station located near he system's zenith jump point, so this new Mican Majority had few problems establishing a link outside their system.&#xD; Today, the Mican worlds are home to a small number of self-sufficient miners. Many of the domes have been converted throughout the years to agricultural use, producing barely enough to sustain the Majority's people. The extensive ore deposits on the three main worlds have been depleted for decades, but numerous small mining operations continue to work claims on the thousands of small, mineral rich asteroids of the Mica system. Though enough to keep the Majority viable, the costs in both men and material climb steadily each year.&#xD; The Majority does field a tiny militia bolstered by a mercenary company, though raids are infrequent. The only recorded invasion, during the mid 3030's, was by "Lady Death" and her forces. She voluntarily pulled out within less than a month after finding no opportunities for quick gains. In fact the Majority has only two attractions. The first is the zenith-point space station, which in addition to being the Majority's only link to the rest of the galaxy has become a crossroads of sorts for Periphery drifters. Nearly half of the station is devoted to massive bazaars and their accompanying taverns, shops, brothels, parts dealers and the like. If it can't be found there, someone who is there can find it.&#xD; The second attraction is an industry of sorts that has grown up after the Truce of Tukayyid. The Mica Majority has become a destination for wealthy Inner Sphere thrill-seekers looking to experience life as a miner for a few weeks. Though no one knows exactly how the burgeoning "industry" began, Mican miners are more than happy to take the money of rich Spheroids in trade for throwing them in the mines and punishing them just like the Combine taskmasters used to push them.</Description>

At first his regiments made remarkable progress, having attacked a region of space where the AFFS had few resources remaining - most being tied up in the ongoing civil war. Midale fell to the Concordat Commando's without much of a struggle in late 3066. &#xD; Meant only to be punitive raids, these successes prompted further strikes with the Taurian regiments now believing they could reclaim their ancient homeworlds, and pay the Federated Suns back for their losses in the Reunification Wars.&#xD; By early 3067 however, and with the civil war coming to an end, Duke George Hasek was able to send a massive force of AFFS regulars and mercenary units to cut the Taurians off and repel them.</Description>

    <Description>[3059] The water-rich world of Midway, with its extensive orbital shipyards, is the home to the Aerospace and Interstellar Institute (AII) which trains its students to serve in aerospace units, DropShips and JumpShips. Recently, the DCMS helped AII create a WarShip training program, which has begun to turn out trainee WarShip crews. The slow turnover in DropShip and JumpShip crews over the past several decades has created little demand for DropShip and JumpShip training: as a result, most AII cadets receive aerospace fighter training. As the DCMS begins to deploy its WarShip fleet, however, more and more cadets have been selected for WarShip training.&#xD; Though AII obtains most of its enrollees from proctor recommendations, the academy also accepts independent petitions for admittance. All prospective enrollees must pass a battery of aptitude tests. The popular rumor that a sixteen-year-old girl from Benjamin gained entrance solely on the dubious achievement of scoring more than one million points on Slayer!, the Combine's most popular arcade aerospace simulator, has never been proved.&#xD; Depending on the course curriculum, AII training programs can last anywhere from six months to two years. AII graduates approximately one hundred fighter pilots a year, but only a handful of DropShip and JumpShip pilots. The academy's WarShip facilities are currently turning out more trained personnel than there are ships to accommodate them, though the DCMS anticipates an increasing need for WarShip crews as WarShip deployment hits high gear. A certain number of AII pilots go on to universities for training as line officers, who command vessels larger than a fighter.&#xD; AII maintains two regiments of aerospace fighters and a few DropShips on Midway for training purposes.</Description>

    <Description>[3062] Leftenant General Juan Nishioka ensured the Milligan DMM was well-trained, building a formidable reputation in spite of the unit's green status. However, Nishioka was also a staunch supporter of Prince Victor, and following the ascension of Katherine Steiner-Davion, forces loyal to the Archon engineered his removal by promoting him to deputy PDZ commander. He was replaced by a political appointee, Jill Farlon, whose lackluster command abilities have set the DMM on a downward spiral.&#xD; Leftenant General Jill Farlon is the daughter of the Duke of Jesup. Her promotion to head the DMM is one of many changes in the AFFC instigated by the Archon-Princess to weaken her brother and strengthen her own position. Though charismatic, Farlon has little command experience and has made a series of poor decisions that have wasted the few resources assigned to the unit. The shortage of parts and ammunition seriously hampers the RCT's performance, and it is estimated that only 40% of the unit would be able to mobilize should a crisis strike the region.</Description>

    <Description>After the Outer Reaches Rebellion and the collapse of Terran authority among the far-flung colony worlds, dozens of planets suddenly found themselves forced to eke out a living on their own, bereft of support for their fledgling industries and booming populations. Milton, by all accounts a paradise at the time, was one such world. Its resources, barely tapped despite a growing number of settlers and a scattering of cities on all four of its interior landmasses - Etienne, Olquia, and Phronx in the north, and Selajia in the south - supported few major industries and only a limited trade other than with Terra itself. &#xD; As a result, the Milton economy was a shambles when the ascendant Terran Hegemony appeared on the scene several years later, and the planet's meager defense force easily broke before the might of Admiral McKenna's forces. Under the Hegemony banner, Milton once more became a prosperous world, exporting industrial metals and radioactive ores along with a host of military and commercial components for use in spacecraft construction and fusion plant design. &#xD; Most of these industries, though minor, were savaged by the troops of Amaris the Usurper, and the few that survived when Milton later became a Lyran holding were eventually lost in the Succession Wars that followed. Even today, large swaths of the interior reaches of Phronx and Selajia are plague zones, a result of the excessive chemical and biological warfare dealt out by both Marik and Steiner troops in the early Succession Wars. Ironically, the lingering effects of this damage and the constant threat of attack from hostile neighbors spared Milton the horrors of the FedCom Civil War.&#xD; The capital city, Paradise Foundation, is located on the Etienne continent, along with the planet's primary spaceport and the headquarters of Milton StarWorks, Limited, Milton's largest spacecraft component manufacturer.</Description>

    <Description>The Surt system is unusual in being one of the very few Class III Giants known to support a family of planets. Two of these fall into the wide habitable zone, but only Surt IV, the world designated as Mira, supports life as we know it. Evidence indicates that only one world, the huge brown dwarf designated Muspheleim (Surt VIII) was originally part of the system. The others were apparently captured by the interplay of the gravitation between the star and the superjovian gas giant. Debates rage to this day in scientific circles as to whether the captures occurred simultaneously or over the space of several hundred thousand years.&#xD; Mira was settled during the early period of Terrestrial colonization in the mid 22nd century. The earliest colonists were of Hispanic descent; these settlers pioneered the extensive oceanic industries that were to make Mira famous. Their first ventures were in the area of pelagiculture; it wasn't until 2237 that the famous Molotosky purification process for recovering minerals from seawater -leaving purified drinking water and saleable by-products - was developed on Mira.&#xD; Mira's conditions can be described as "habitable" only with a large dose of charity. Mass and density combine to produce a gravity of nearly 1.8 times Terra-standard. The atmosphere pressure at sea level is 2.20 atm. Coupled with a partial pressure of oxygen of nearly 9.5, this makes the air of Mira subtly lethal. The density of the atmosphere is uncomfortable and requires long periods of depressurization before entry into conditioned environments is possible; the high oxygen content is doubly dangerous in feeding fires at incredible rates and causing hypoxia-induced hallucinations in some people, particularly after unusual exertion.&#xD; The planetary atmosphere is only thin enough to support life at all because of the effects of the energetic star, which has stripped away much of the atmosphere over the past few million years. The heat also combines with extensive hydrosphere to produce a massive layer of clouds. The greenhouse effect on Mira effectively doubles temperatures that might be found on less humid worlds. Misty, swampy conditions prevail over much of the planet. However, Mira is more geologically active than Terra, supporting large mountain chains, which in many places rise up above the cloud layers. These peaks often extend high enough to boast quite Terra-like conditions of temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity that serve as interesting contrasts to the marshy jungles at sea level. The largest of these high plates is the continent-sized formation known as Mesa Grande near the equator, which is home to the capital of Ciudad Mira.&#xD; High radiation output from Surt and the harsh environmental conditions of the planetary surface have contributed to a surprising diversity and spread of life forms native to Mira. The jungles and swamps of the lower reaches of the Miran continents support lush vegetation and a variety of interesting animal forms, including pseudo-reptilian types which show a number of points of similarity to Terrestrial dinosaurs - aside from being six-limbed, homethermic, viviparous, and being much more cunning than any dinosaur that ever walked Terra.&#xD; The biochemistry of Mira is only partly compatible with that of Terra. Humans can obtain nourishment from Miran sources, but without hideously expensive vitamin supplements they must consume better than three times the bulk to obtain the same nutritional value as Terra foodstuffs give. Miran food is cheap and plentiful, and for the very poor provides the staple dirt, which lead to a curious combination of malnutrition and weight problems among those who cannot afford vitamins or Terran foodstuffs.&#xD; Mira today is still a world of contrasts. Large tracts of polar and mesa upland regions are heavily urbanized and industrialized. In its heyday, the planet Mira was parceled out as luxury estates for Tikonov nobles and their families. Like the estates of Terra's Russian nobility centuries before, the Tikonov landholdings on Mira have been converted to museums for the edification of offworld tourists.&#xD; The manufacture of textiles (the largest manufacturers advertise themselves as "clothiers to the galaxy"), and other agro-byproducts, as well as light and heavy manufacturing are the principal industries of Mira. Overall the standard of living is very low on Mira; the beeswarm millions in numerous cities earn marginal livings at best. Symptoms of poverty are widespread - problems with crime, prostitution, controlled substance abuse, and the like - are everywhere in the major population centers. Perhaps the worst conditions of all are found among the seafarers who must work constantly in the lowland heat, and in the various port cities along the lowland shores which continue to support the pelagic industries.</Description>

The geological record on Mirach shows that it was long a frozen, uninhabitable planet, until its parent star entered the current phase of its life cycle. As a result, the thick glaciers that once covered Mirach's ores and minerals have melted, and no erosion or life-forms have had a chance to cover its riches with soil. Mirach's readily accessible riches granted it considerable power in its early history. Mirach's government laid claim to nearby planets like Mira, Mesartim, and Almach. However, Mirach's wealth attracted more-powerful states, including the Federated Suns, the Tikonov Union, and the Marlette Association, which fought several battles over the planet, dashing Mirach's hopes of empire. &#xD; After the Tikonov Union joined the Capellan Confederation, the Terran Hegemony and House Liao jointly administered Mirach, with the world falling wholly into House Liao's hands at the end of the First Star League. Mirach remained under House Liao until the Third Succession War, when House Davion conquered the world.&#xD; Mirach's capital of Cingulum lies on the continent of Musasalah. Mirach's other major landmass is Ventrale.</Description>

Baron Kithrong finally pulled back his wayward Sixth and violently cut himself of from the rest of the Concordat.&#xD; Led by Baron Kithrong, the people of six of the Concordat's spinward-most colonies banded together and announced their secession from the Taurian Concordat as a whole until Erik Martens-Calderon is named Protector; Kithrong has publicly sworn that he will see Erik on the Taurian throne or die trying. Formerly recognized on the 19th December 3066, the so-called Calderon Protectorate's capital is based on Erod's Escape.&#xD; This action has sent ripples throughout the Concordat, with its effects still being felt in the region.

    <Description>Though it bakes beneath a huge sun that is, in fact, part of a double-binary star system, Mizar has managed to become known as one of the greatest resort worlds in the Inner Sphere. The arrangement of the double binary system leads to complex solar cycles on Mizar that assure the planet is fully lit almost perpetually. Varying degrees of sunlight from the four A-class suns of the Mizar system produce peculiarly long and irregular seasons, varying from a temperate terrestrial springtime to a lingering tropical heat wave � even at the poles. &#xD; Despite the heat, however, Mizar was miraculously blessed with an abundance of water, native life, and breathtaking vistas from New Venice Beach, the planet�s longest stretch of snow-white sands, along the eastern coast of the Paradasia continent, to the �plastic crystal� mountains of the southern Utopian Isles. These features made Mizar a tourist spot almost from the moment of its discovery, and the hospitality of the natives became legendary. They welcomed the Terran Hegemony when Admiral McKenna first forged the empire that would one day rule the Star League, and throughout humanity�s Golden Age Mizar was jointly administered by the Hegemony and the neighboring Lyran Commonwealth.&#xD; Their economy booming as a tourist spot, the Mizarians came to obsess about appearances and all the finer things in life, from fancy cars and the latest fashions, to palatial estates and cutting-edge sculptures made from native �plastic crystal,� all meticulously groomed and refined for maximum beauty at all times. The Amaris Crisis, which precipitated the fall of the Star League, spared Mizar only because the Lyran government�s troops were already on-planet in force when word of the coup broke out; Amaris decided against putting another Successor State at his throat while Kerensky�s noose closed around him.&#xD; Throughout the Succession Wars few raids were launched against the world, but those few invaders who did land on the surface often as not found themselves unable to bring themselves to harm the planet�s greatest natural and man-made wonders, instead hoping to capture this world intact. The absence of significant military or industrial resources also made Mizar a poor invasion candidate.&#xD; Today, visitors are more than welcome to land at any of the four major spaceports on the Majestica, Paradasia, Solasia, and Wunderlund continents, though the capital city of NouveauParis on Solasia remains the most stunning of the planet�s hot spots � and the best place to get a good Fire Lizard, Mizar�s very own specialty drink.</Description>

    <Description>The genesis of the festival, known alternately as the Festival of Giving and as the Feast of Bounty, is lost to history. What is known is that it grew to significance on a group of Outback worlds, from Molino to Weldon, during the Reunification War and expanded out from there. Equal parts religious and secular, this festival is very popular within the Outback and on major agrarian worlds, and it celebrates the annual harvest (or whichever of a world�s multiple harvests is typically the most bountiful). Of course, as every world has a different seasonal cycle, this particular festival is celebrated at varying times throughout the Federated Suns. &#xD; In fact, there are several interstellar concerns, the largest of which is owned and operated by the Green Star Corporation, that specialize in traveling from world to world to organize and run these celebrations. Every world observes slightly different customs in their celebration of the Festival of Giving or the Feast of Bounty, but in general the festival lasts from three to five days and includes the showing of animals, massive feasts, music, dancing, and sometimes a carnival.</Description>

They welcomed any hope of battle, for they knew that would at least keep the Chancellor and her evil eye from targeting them as she had struck out at so many of her other military leaders.&#xD; Archie McCarron was surprised when three CCAF senior colonels visited him on Menke in May of 3039, and all but stunned when they suggested he undertake an operation of such magnitude into the Federated Suns. But as he looked over the intelligence reports that they had brought with them, McCarron was quickly won over. This was by no means a full-fledged invasion, however; the CCAF was still far too weak to even consider such a possibility. &#xD; In fact, more than anything, this was designed to be more of a morale-building exercise. The CCAF had just recently driven the Canopians from their nation, but that victory was tempered by the fact that it took five years of military action to do so. What the CCAF needed was a true victory, one that was unmistakable and could proclaim to the entire Human Sphere that the Confederation was once again a military power, and who better to target than the mighty Federated Suns.&#xD; In striking Monhegan, Archie McCarron missed out on the supply cache the Fifth Syrtis Fusiliers undoubtedly left behind when they left the world of Cammal half a year earlier to take up position on the Draconis border world of David. On the other hand, when he planned the operation and chose the targets, Colonel McCarron made sure that none of his regiments would be more than one jump away from the assistance of at least two other MAC units, and Cammal was outside of that range. &#xD; So while there was little of strategic value on this second world that McCarron targeted, Monhegan was on the way to Kathil. McCarron assigned this world to his third regiment, the Wild Ones, who proceeded to crush the Monhegan Militia in just three days of fighting. That left four more days for the regiment to pillage and steal what they could. &#xD; Whilst finding little in the way of practical military supplies, prior to departing the world on 31 July, the Wild Ones did manage to loot almost two thousand barrels of fine aged wines and other alcohols from Spraacher, a mountain city that had centuries earlier made a name for itself because of the outstanding vineyards and distilleries that occupied the surrounding hills and valleys. &#xD; McCarron gifted several hundred barrels of wines and spirits to the Chancellor and members of the Strategios, and had several hundred more sold; the rest, just less than half of the take, remained within the unit and basically lasted the Big Mac less than four years, though the wine cellar that Archie himself formed after the operation still continues to supply his successor today.&#xD; [3065] During the FedCom Civil War, the Capellan Confederation sponsored several uprisings on the Capellan March world of Monhegan. Only several swift police actions by the Federated Freemen � a mercenary unit in the employ of Duke Hasek � prevented the uprisings from escalating further.</Description>

The Chancellor was becoming more and more paranoid, and succumbing to the same madness as her father. While first Maximilian and now Romano Liao had left them mostly to their own devices, they knew that would not last forever. They welcomed any hope of battle, for they knew that would at least keep the Chancellor and her evil eye from targeting them as she had struck out at so many of her other military leaders.&#xD; Archie McCarron was surprised when three CCAF senior colonels visited him on Menke in May of 3039, and all but stunned when they suggested he undertake an operation of such magnitude into the Federated Suns.

What the CCAF needed was a true victory, one that was unmistakable and could proclaim to the entire Human Sphere that the Confederation was still a military power, and who better to target than the mighty Federated Suns.&#xD; On the surface, Monongahela was yet another seemingly poor target � a moderately-inhabited world with just the most basic of modern industry and a healthy ranching business. But what most analyses misses was that the world was also a forward-deployment base for the Kathil Capellan March Militia prior to the Fourth Succession War, and that it still held relatively large warehouses. Still better, the Monongahela Militia was sorely under-staffed and under-equipped. Even if there was little in the way of equipment left, the potential cost was still considered worth the risk.&#xD; This seventh target was entrusted to Carhart�s Demons. Colonel Nicholas Carhart and his Fourth MAC landed and immediately began searching for the old CMM storehouses. Like LosTech prospectors straight out of the Holo-vids, Carhart�s Demons scoured the lands, unearthing and unsealing bunkers left untouched for over a decade. The mercenaries encountered the militia only twice, and both times left no survivors. And just like clockwork, they left a week after they arrived, having scavenged 247 tons of miscellaneous weapons, spare parts, armor and rations from the bunkers. &#xD; Instead of continuing on to Kathil, however, the Demons began the trek back to the Confederation. Colonel Archie McCarron ordered them home just as soon as the extent of the damage that the AFFS was doing to their homeworld of Menke was clear.</Description>

    <Description>[3025] The public of the Federated Suns thinks very little of rising up and deposing a noble who has not proven himself worthy of his position. The two most common ways are public appeal or direct action. In public appeal, the people go before the planetary government to state their case against the noble's administration of a baronage or county. The right to public inquiry does not necessarily guarantee immediate removal of the offending noble. Rather, it brings the matter to the attention of the nobleman's superior, who will then decide his fate. &#xD; Most recently, Baron Defreders of Coal Valley on Montcoal was removed from power after three years of legal maneuvering. After the local mine union accused the Baron of ignoring their concerns about the safety of the mines, it still required the action of the Federation Judiciary and the assistance of the Ministry of Administrative Services to depose him.</Description>

    <Description>Moore is a wet world, it's total landmass locked up in almost a thousand small islands and the long, thin, mountainous chain known as Serpentasia. This half-wooded, half-swampy land runs in an irregular northwest-to-southeast path across Moore's surface, and is home to the vast majority of the planetary population, including the capital city of Shizuoka. &#xD; Because of abundant germanium, titanium, and uranium deposits, this world was a prize to both the Draconis Combine and the Terran Hegemony alike during humanity's Golden Age, and it was to secure these valuable resources that both realms agreed to share the planet between them. This shared-world status spared Moore the horrors of the Amaris crisis when the Usurper, secure in his hold over House Kurita, allowed Combine troops to hold the planet unmolested during his reign of terror.&#xD; When Amaris and his troops fell to the SLDF, and the League itself collapsed soon after, Moore became a de facto holding of the Combine. The Combine has jealously defended Moore after claiming it, losing it to house Steiner's Lyran Commonwealth for only a few decades in the twenty-ninth, during the Second Succession War. House Steiner then re-captured Moore in 3030, during the Forth Succession War, though it eventually reverted back into Kuritan hands when Coordinator Theodore Kurita annexed the so called 'Lyons Thumb' in 3062. Despite the countless raids to claim this world's riches, industry and commerce managed to thrive.</Description>

    <Description>One of the strangest mutinies in history occurred in 2970, when mercenaries from Beaufort's Cossacks went on a shooting spree in a suburb of New Defiance City on the planet Moravian. A clause in the unit's contract specified that twice a week the government would pay for a free meal for all members of the unit at a local Triple-F restaurant, the most popular chain in the Federated Suns. The fact that Capellan naval forces blockaded Moravian shortly after the unit's arrival should not have made any difference, as Moravian produced its own wheat, beef, corn, sugar, milk, and potatoes. The only offworld elements of Triple-F cuisine were pickles, sesame seeds, and whalemeat. Nevertheless, when the troops could not get exactly what they ordered, Colonel Regnus accused Triple-F of defaulting on the unit's food supply contract.&#xD; The manager of the outlet, afraid of losing the most lucrative contract he had ever had, was quick to point out that the blockade had prevented supplies from arriving. He went on to say that he had in good faithful filled the contract as best he could, and that even if he could have anticipated the blockade, he did not have facilities to refrigerate a whale. Upon hearing this, the Cossacks, against orders from Colonel Regnus, went on a rampage, commandeering civilian motor vehicles, screaming out the windows at the natives, and discharging their weapons. They stormed the Triple-F franchise, chanting "Where's the pickle? Where's the lettuce?" Their chant made no sense, as Triple-F had never used lettuce in any of its products. (Perhaps the troops were confusing the eatery with a similar, competing chain.) &#xD; The manager and staff, frightened by the outburst, fled the restaurant. After a few minutes more of chanting, the troops began to feel foolish and left. &#xD; Colonel Regnus took no disciplinary action. He remarked to one of his aides, "We've got to get these soldiers into a real fight. When they start letting off steam like this, the cutting edge is definitely off the rose."&#xD; Despite all the commotion and the shooting, not a single civilian was hurt during the soldier's outburst.&#xD; [3056] Moravian is also home to a little-known inter-realm trading company, Alaski Goods. Business has not been good for Alaski in recent years, with trade runs into the Capellan Confederation and Free Worlds League becoming increasingly more difficult. Bandit forces have also made attempts to capture Alaski ships, though have so far not succeeded.</Description>

    <Description>Mosiro lies at the center of the Mosiro Archipelago, which also includes El Giza and Hudeiba. Primarily Arabic and Islamic in origin, the people of Mosiro tend to oppose the Marik and his cosmopolitanism in Parliament. Although the planetary government officially holds the same tolerance for religious dissent and social diversity as the rest of the Free Worlds, there are some local variances. For example, all citizens and visitors are expected to respond to the Muezzin's call to prayer. Although this is not required by law, any non-Moslems are required to apply to a government bureaucracy to be excused from the daily prayers. Moslems are given preference in employment, and 'infidels' are far less frequently promoted in their jobs.   &#xD; Mosiro is not a parochial place, however. Its leadership takes pride in hearkening back to the days of the European Dark Ages of old Terra, when Moslem civilization was at its peak. Moslem architecture rises majestically from the plains of Mosiro, and the people take pride in their accomplishments in poetry, the arts, and science. Mosiro's second city, Al-Hassam, houses the most astrophysical laboratories outside Terra itself, and the capital, Al-Ilb, boasts a cultural complex that includes government archives, library, art and natural history museums, public park, hanging gardens and waterfalls, and the largest mosque in the Free Worlds, all of which combines to rival the Alhambra of old Spain on Terra.&#xD; In this enlightened cultural environment, the only major theological conflict in recent decades came in the 2990's, when a group attempted to resurrect a Terran religion called Rastafarianism on Mosiro. The Rastsfarians' belief in a millennial, apocalyptic destruction of 'Babylon' (everything outside themselves), and their smoking of marijuana as a sacrament caused them to be persecuted wholesale. Since the coming of the new millennium, they have largely disappeared, having apparently gone underground until the next millennium.</Description>

In an ill-planned attempt to beat the Clan forces at their own game, Sheng-jo issued a badly worded challenge to the Clan commander and got exactly what he asked for. The Lancer's battle Trinaries immediately engaged the bulk of the Ninth while the Elementals and Striker Trinary flanked the defenders. Caught in a pincer, the Ninth bolted and the Cats pursued. &#xD; Hoping to slow the Clan onslaught by forcing them to fight in the streets of the capital, Mualang City, Sheng-jo again proved his imperfect knowledge of the Clan way of thinking by assuming that their philosophy of minimizing collateral damage would prevent them from wreaking havoc in a populated area. The Lancers charged straight through the city in pursuit of the Ninth's assault elements, forcing the Regulars into a full retreat toward their Dropships. Unfortunately for the Ninth, the Clans had already captured their only means of escape off Mualang.&#xD; [3059] In the only fighting between the Nova cats and the DCMS in the second wave of Operation Bulldog, the 119th Striker Cluster clashed with the First Proserpina Hussars on Mualang. However, as Tai-sa Alexander Minowa demonstrated to the Ninth Nova Cat Regulars, the First was up to the task and handily defeated the 119th.</Description>

    <Description>A large, populous world blessed with a habitable satellite (Oasis), Murchison was a colonists' dream when it was discovered in the early days of space flight. Though gravity was slightly greater and the atmosphere somewhat heavier than Terran-normal, Murchison's ample water supply, fertile soils, and mineral wealth invited millions of eager colonists to the planet. &#xD; An assortment of civilian industries grew on Murchison and its satellite, particularly electronics, pharmaceuticals, automotive, and aerospace industries. Cattle farming, which proved more suited to the planet, and agriculture on the primary moon, provided an interesting food-trading network between the dual worlds that kept both populations well fed and virtually self-sufficient.&#xD; However, this symbiotic balance became disrupted more than a few times during the Succession Wars, when invading troops used the smaller Oasis as a jump-off point for attacks on Murchison itself. Today, much of the surface of Oasis still bears the scars of several battles, and its settlers have mostly relocated to Murchison, leaving the moon a largely military holding of the planetary government. &#xD; Murchison itself has three main continents, Abla, Haschweld, and Felkra, home to its capital city of Murchison City. Oasis' two continents, Schultz and Rhinehold, by comparison, are home only to the lunar capital of Fort Wolfe and the principal spaceport of Laubenstein.</Description>

    <Description>One of the first trade centers developed during the Exodus, Nanking was incorporated into the Tikonov Union during the late 23rd century.  Today, Nanking serves as a large regional naval base and supports the Warrior House Daidachi regiment.  In addition, it is a commercial rival of Styk.  Local deposits of platinum and copper attract considerable interstellar trade and exchange.  Some 17 percent of all commerce received by the entire Capellan Confederation annually flows through Nanking. &#xD; From 2901 through 2910, elements of an elite strike force (code named "Red Rover") containing units of the Defenders of Andurien and the Orloff Grenadiers, conducted a series of deep penetration raids against key Liao supply depots at Aldebarran, Shensi and Nanking. The raid culminated in the daring capture of a fully laded iceship, the "Silver Frost," as it prepared to depart the Buenos Aires system. With the Silver Frost in tow, the Red Rovers launched a multi-pronged assault on the then Liao desert world of Zion, routing the defending garrison from its fortifications in the Gapston mountain range.&#xD; [3025] A subsidiary of Earthwerks Ltd., specializing in light and medium BattleMechs, Kallon Industries is identified with its most famous design, the Rifleman, used widely throughout the Inner Sphere. Kallon Industries plants on Asuncion and Bernado now produce BattleMechs for their current captors, House Marik. This has significantly scaled down Capellan BattleMech production capability. In recent years, Kallon has expanded into the manufacture of small arms and laser weapons systems. Though financially stable, Kallon Industries is unlikely ever to be a serious competitor of Earthwerks or comparable 'Mech producers outside the Capellan systems.&#xD; Named for the importance of its 'Mech industries, the capital of Nanking is Kallontown.&#xD; Nanking is also the site of one of the 16 Philotechnique Institutes. These serve the Capellan state as special post-secondary institutions. Established originally in the mid-28th century as technical and scientific training centers, the institutes today also emphasize "philosophical" (political) training. Admission to a Philotechnique Institute is by special recommendation of a planetary director only, and all expenses are paid by the state. Often enough, students in these institutions have previously served with distinction as members of the Ranks of the Dedicated. Graduates who are not technically oriented are placed in positions of administrative responsibility, or are recruited into the ranks of the Maskirovka.</Description>

Following his father's vision, Nicholas announced in 2621 his intention to finish uniting the member states' economies by creating the Star League Dollar. This became the standard currency everywhere. The member states were allowed to print the new currency for their own realms under close supervision, but the Star League government determined the amount.&#xD; First Lord Nicholas also set up the central Stock Exchange (CSE), which allowed ten regional exchange businesses to trade shares in foreign companies. In addition to aiding the economy, the exchanges were supposed to promote peace between the realms, as having economic interests in neighboring states made war less attractive.&#xD; The Central Stock Exchange was located in the Terran city of London. The other stock exchanges and the Star League mints were set up on border worlds between the member states. They were grouped into commerce cities built by the Star League for the use of economists, brokers, and company executives. The cities' protection came from the SLDF, which usually had a major military base nearby.&#xD; Currency on Narellan, was one such city; it's mint produced currency for both the Federated Suns and Capellan Confederation. With collapse of the Star League, the border world locations of the commerce cities proved to be their downfall, as they soon became targets.

    <Description>Valuable minerals, chemical wealth, and advanced electronics, metallurgical and hydrocarbon fuel industries-coupled with a pleasant terrestrial climate-made Nashira a valuable world to both the Draconis Combine and the Terran Hegemony. Rather than fighting over it, however, the Camerons and Kuritas reached a compromise in which the planet would be jointly administered, with the planet's exports divided evenly between their governments. This "shared world" status made Nashira a cosmopolitan planet, with diverse Hegemony cities standing side by side with those of the heavily Japanese-influenced Combine. &#xD; Of course, the simmering hostilities that tended to flare up between Combine and Hegemony citizens were worse on Nashira than on many other planets. The worst of these incidents occurred during the so-called Hidden War, when outraged Kuritans, furious over the outcome of an epic clash on Solaris VII between SLDF Gunslinger Daniel Allison and a so-called ronin named Kaneda Fujima, rioted in the capital of Logan City. The Hegemony city, forced to call in troops to quell the violence, requested the aid of both SLDF and DCMS troops on world, as was protocol during such disturbances. Unfortunately, in a few instances the troops found themselves drawn into the conflict, with SLDF units firing upon Combine troops and vice versa. More than two thousand lives were lost in the three bloody days of the Logan Riots, a black stain on the honor of both states. &#xD; After the fall of the Star League, Nashira became a Combine holding, which made use of the local industries and valuable minerals to strengthen its military machine and its economic might. The Combine launched an extensive campaign to transform the planet into a fully Japanese culture, including the demolition, renovation and renaming of many Hegemony cities and towns. Residents who clung to non-Japanese cultures and ideologies were persecuted and segregated, but true atrocities were rare. For this reason, Nashira remains a diverse world.&#xD; Logan City, on the northern continent of Katiasha, is still the planetary capital, with a population of almost five million. Ogawa, a city still thick with Combine influence, lies fifty kilometers south of Logan City and is the planet's major spaceport as well as home to a third of the planetary defense forces. On Nashira's southern continent of Copenwald are found the majority of the planet's mining and manufacturing industries, including DeValt Industries, a minor manufacturer of MinerMechs and ConstructionMechs, based in the city of New Anaheim.</Description>

In September of 3060, the St. Ives Compact's Blackwind Lancers staged an abortive raid against the Capellan world of Hustaing. In response, acting as First Lord of the Star League, Capellan Chancellor Sun-Tzu Liao ordered SLDF units to occupy several Compact worlds, ostensibly as peacekeepers.&#xD; He placed the Fifth Lyran Regulars on Nashuar, who almost immediately began a tense standoff against the Seventh FedCom RCT, a unit that had garrisoned the compact for years. In January of 3061, the so-called peace-keeping mission turned into a war of aggression when St. Ives units and the SLDF clashed over First Lord Liao's orders to place Compact worlds under martial law.&#xD; The fight on Nashuar turned bitter almost instantly, with the Seventh F-C and the Fifth Regulars showing each other little in the way of mercy. Supported by the Nashuar Home Guard, the Seventh had the better position on the world and refused to give anything to the Fifth Regulars other than cramped landing zones. The Fifth responded by making a lightning breakout from their LZ in the city of Grianet and into the Salt River Canyon. From that point, the fight degenerated into a battle that would eerily resemble many of the fights of the Civil War.&#xD; By April of 3062, the situation within the Compact had turned into a full-fledged war with the Confederation and the Fifth was rapidly losing cohesion. A final push by the Seventh, spearheaded by its armor brigade, drove the Fifth off the world and back into the Lyran Alliance.</Description>

Though they knew their defense would be hopeless in the face of the overwhelming Clan force, the Neerabup militia valiantly engaged the invaders, sustaining horrendous casualties. The courage of the militia impressed the Jade Falcons, and the survivors were taken as bondsmen with a view to inducting them into the Falcon Touman.&#xD; However, the Falcon's hegira from Coventry prompted them to release all bondsmen taken in the campaign, including the Neerabup survivors. Surprisingly, a few militia warriors chose to remain with the Falcons. In the four years since the assault, the militia has managed to rebuild, but progress has been slow.&#xD; Colonel Mary Polk took command of the reformed militia in 3059, charged with overseeing its reconstruction. She has struggled to overcome the "us and them" mentality that separates those survivors of the original militia who were captured by the Falcons and the new recruits assigned to the unit. Fortunately, the standard rotation of troops through the militia has worked in her favor.&#xD; Colonel Abigail Coombes, the commander of the Neerabup MTM Infantry Brigade, is the highest ranked survivor of the Falcon assault on Neerabup, having served as a Kommandant in the Ninth Howick MR.

Unfortunately, Archon Melissa Steiner-Davion and her husband sorely misjudged the extent of the influence of Duke Ryan Steiner and Free Skye held within the Lyran military machine. By the end of the decade, Skye loyalists held most of the command positions within the unit, with Skye Federation natives rapidly filling up the lower ranks as well.&#xD; Today, the LAAF is keeping a close eye on the unit and especially its officers. Though it was not implicated in the most recent rebellion attempt, the entire Militia RCT did enter a state of high alert as the first stage of the rebellion began, declaring martial law in the few regions where protests against secession would likely occur.

Although most were small unit raids mounted merely to test Marik resolve, others targeted specific objectives such as FWLM supply depots and vital manufacturing plants. Other attacks were more involved affairs, intended by Commonwealth planners to pin down troops to allow smaller Lyran forces unimpeded access to their targets.&#xD; On Nestor, the Fifth Orloff Grenadiers came under attack by the Fourth Donegal Guards. Though they failed to capture the Selathon industrial complex, they blooded the Grenadiers and forced Captain-General Janos Marik to divert forces to the Lyran border, thereby extending the civil war against his rebellious brother.&#xD; [3035] Ever open for opportunities to exploit, the possibilities offered by a distracted Free Worlds prompted Archon Katrina Steiner to keep a close eye on the border despite her own difficulties in Skye and the preparations for a renewed offensive against the Draconis Combine.&#xD; The raid on Nestor was one of a succession of probing attacks carried out by units such as the Second and Third Republicans on the orders of the canny archon, but the Fifth Brigade of the Fusiliers of Oriente turned back the raid with minimal losses.

    <Description>[3039] During the War of 3039, Lima was one of the worlds targeted primarily by mercenaries. Like the other worlds involved in these mercenary-supported actions, Lima was once a part of the Federated Suns but was lost to the Draconis Combine during the Fourth Succession War. As such it had a significant anti-Kurita feeling among its population. On the other hand, the world�s governor was something of an oddity. A retired DCMS Sho-sho, Yosuki Yamada was interested in promoting harmony on the world. He had opened his own military academy, of sorts, and was building up industry on the world using contacts he still had within the DCMS and its military suppliers. Thus, while AFFS special forces troops had little trouble finding citizens willing to stand up against Yamada and the Combine, they knew they would have problems with those that supported the governor.&#xD; On the other hand, the mercenary Cunningham�s Commandos was tasked to assist the uprising. This was not the unit�s first time on the world, as it had actually served briefly in the personal employ of Yamada several years earlier when he was first assigned to the world and was having troubles with pirates and even rogue Combine warriors. As soon as the mercenaries landed, the struggle for New Aberdeen began. Special forces-assisted insurgents stormed government buildings in fifteen cities, with mercenary �Mech lances taking up positions within the most important of cities. Governor Yamada was captured within an hour, but taken into protective custody by the mercenaries after a group of insurgents threatened to execute him and any other Combine-installed officials.&#xD; The struggle for New Aberdeen did not end with Yamada�s capture, though. Citizens and militia troops on both sides of the fight continued on, leading to a low-level guerrilla war that lasted for months. In fact, the fighting became so brutal that the mercenaries distanced themselves from the action, lest they be drawn into a conflict where they might have to fire upon unarmed civilians. By July, the world had gone up like a powderkeg; cities were literally burning while the two sides fought over territory like rival street gangs. &#xD; Thousands had died already, and the death toll was only going to keep going up if someone or something didn�t put an end to the violence. Perhaps just as tragically, productivity on the world had dropped to almost nothing; those who didn�t take up arms on one side or the other were too scared to leave their houses and go to work. Even the arrival of the Twelfth Galedon Regulars had little effect on the fighting.&#xD; It did, however, inspire a solution. Retired Sho-sho Yosuki Yamada convinced the leader of the Cunningham�s Commandos to meet with his counterpart within the Twelfth Galedon Regulars. The mercenary leader recognized that there was little way he and his MechWarriors could hold off the Regulars for any length of time, while the commander of the Regulars knew he would need as much help as possible to calm emotions on the world. And though the Regulars would chafe at the thought of working side-by-side with the mercenaries, Sho-sho Yamada was the world�s military and civilian governor and was calling the shots.&#xD; So, on 17 August, the joint Combine-mercenary force embarked on a peace-keeping mission. City by city, they disarmed the entire populations, imprisoning the worst offenders on both sides of the fight and forming a police force to maintain the peace in conjunction with the Galedon Regulars� infantry. After just a week of this, many of the people actively fighting each other across the planet went back to their regular lives, especially after they realized that the mercenaries and the DCMS were working together to end the violence. There were still a significant number of citizens fighting, though, and the joint peacekeeping force spent the next three months ending the worst of the violence.&#xD; Cunningham�s Commandos left the world in early December, and though initially charged with aiding the enemy, were acquitted after a communiqu� from Yamada reached the High Command.</Description>

To make matters worse, the land was infested with insect-like creatures carrying more diseases than could be counted.&#xD; In spite of this, the colonists drained the swamplands, leaving what proved to be dynamically fertile land that was able to sustain a large farming population. Additionally, the native amphibian life became a delicacy that was soon exported as gourmet items. In addition, New Aragon became a leading center for medical research. The capital of Argos, located on the continent of Glastonbury, is home to the New Aragon Institute of Epidermiology - a leading Inner Sphere medical research facility.&#xD; Of course, New Aragon has also seen its share of military action. When Davion forces, lead by Marshal Peter Davion captured New Aragon in 2930, the people rebelled against their new masters. It was not until 3013, with Hanse Davion as Military Governor, that the AFFS restored order; Prince Hanse earned his nickname "The Fox" whilst on New Aragon.

The report that the Camelot tiled on the planet was so glowing that New Avalon quickly became one of the prime destinations for shiploads of colonists leaving Terra between the years 2213 and 2221. What the colonists found when they arrived was a world of five continents, four seas, a fairly reasonable weather pattern. abundant fresh water, and a profusion of lifeforms that seemed to accommodate the colonists very well.  It was quickly discovered that the planet was best-suited to agriculture. By crossing Terran plants with varieties indigenous to New Avalon, the colonists had soon bred several important grain crops. The most famous of these is New Avalon wheat, which is exfremely hardy and now grows throughout the Inner Sphere. Since then, New Avalon, with its countless square kilometers of open rolling country. has always managed to supply enough food for itself and its five nearest neighbor planets, despite the decline in agricultural technology brought on by the wars Though its ag-ricultural strength is usually overshadowed by the tact that New Avalon is the capital of the Federated Suns, the planet 5 fertility is vital to the well-being of the entire Crucis March.

The continent also has the planet's only large deposit of precious metals. The continental capital of New Scotland is Dundee.  The New Hebrides is a group of islands in the planet's largest sea. Lying near New Avalon's equator, the islands have the hot climate that makes tropical plants and fruits the region's main export. The New Hebrides also have some high mountain ranges. Combined with the islands' location. These mountains attract rather vicious hurricanes that often cause heavy damage to the local communities. The largest of these islands is Carlisle. The continental capital of the New Hebrides is Thomasville.  The continent of Fiostock is the third largest on New Avalon. A large and flat landmass, it has the planet's only desert, the Orilands, and the planet's only large canyon. Gaveston's Gorge. Rostock produces a substantial part of New Avalon's food animals. Large sections of the continent are owned by noble families who raise a wide variety of animals that are exported otfworld to satisfy hungry people throughout the Federated Suns. The continental capital of Rostock is Flensburg.  Brunswick is the second-largest continent. It was named after the Brunswick family, major landowners during the planet's early history. Today, Brunswick boasts spaceports. Three major cities, and a majority of the several large centers of oil production. As well as two major planet 5 many industries. It also has numerous small farms and ranches. The continental capital of Brunswick is Brunswick City.  Albion is the largest continent on New Avalon. The continent is also the most geographically diverse, with three mountain ranges, many large rivers. Thick forests, and large prairies. Albion is also the location of most of New Avalon's industries. Avalon City is triply honored as capital of the continent, capital of the Federated Suns, and ancestral home of the Davion family.  Avalon City began life as a theme park. During the first century of Human life on this world, an eccentric millionaire decided that there should be at least one place on New Avalon that matched the planet's medieval geographical names. For the location of his theme park, he chose a large island where the continent's three major rivers, the Albion, the Thames, and the Cris, came together. This site was baptized the Isle of Avalon.  Though the park buildings have long since fallen into ruin the romantic medievalism has remained. When the Davions took control of the area, they promoted the tradition of festivals extolling the virtues of knighthood in flower.  Lucien's rise to power made it clear that the Davions would rule over the planet for many years, for he decided to incorporate the medievalism of the former theme park into the architecture of a new capital city. Dominating the city from atop Mount Davion is the Royal Palace, which some still refer to as Camelot. It is an enlarged copy of an English medieval fortress that Lucien had seen as a youth during a trip to Terra. The Royal Court is a complex of buildings and halls housing the ministries of the Federated Suns. It was built at the foot of Mount Davion just below the Palace. Protecting the Palace, the Court, and Avalon City is a battalion of Davion's elite Royal Brigade, which is stationed just between the Royal Court and the city.  Since the completion of Avalon City in the late 2390s, expansion has slowly eroded the medieval flavor. Buildings constructed outside the core of the city. Which is known as the Old City or the Government District, were not obliged to install medieval facades and so adopted modern styles.  Some 30 kilometers to the south of Avalon City. in what used to be a private game preserve of the Davions, is the New Avalon Institute of Science. The seven colleges each specialize in a particular discipline, though inter-college learning is encouraged. The many university buildings cluster about a large and comfortable campus. Nearby are the training grounds for BaittleMech and AeroSpace Pilots, and the university's private spaceport.  Security is tight around the Institute's many secret projects. Indeed, the NAIS can be reached only via underground subways or by flying into the university's spaceport, which allows the government to keep close track of who enters and leaves the university. As a deterrent and a force of last resort, two BattleMech battalions are stationed within the university grounds to help with security. They also serve as skilled opponents to cadets of the NAIS BattleMech Training School.  Hidden in the mountain range that extends west from Mount Davion is the Davion military headquarters. Known as The Mountain, or as the Fox's Den, it is a complex of huge caves and transportation tunnels deep inside a granite mountain. The magnetically levitated subways lead to and from Avalon City, as well as to the two 'Mech battalions and accompanying fighters hid-den in strategically placed caverns throughout the valleys of the mountain range. The need for a heavily fortified military headquarters became evident during the First Succession War, when Draconis Combine forces pushed to within one jump of an under- defended New Avalon.  Despite the collapse of the Star League and the three wars that followed, New Avalon has managed to maintain a fairly high level of technology. The planet's population, though large, lives a comfortable life scattered over the four continents. Public morale is high, with only a few dissidents among the youthful radicals at the Gogh-Bukowski University. Avalon City draws toil many of the realm's best artists, who have embellished the city with their art. New Avalon and Avalon City may be the most agreeable of the five major capitals of the Successor States.</Description>

    <Description>[2334] In 2330, Shiro Kurita turned the armies of his brother and warlord, Urizen Kurita, towards the Principality of Rasalhague. During the first three years of the campaign, Urizen encountered only token resistance. Several Rasalhague member-worlds fell in a matter of months, with Combine advances limited more by logistics than by the minimal opposition. Using "leap-frogging" techniques, the Kuritans seized planets in a seemingly erratic sequence. &#xD; In this way, Urizen would continue to keep the enemy off guard while always creating an advance staging base for upcoming attacks. Other planets would then be taken during a second wave, sometimes two to four years later. Moderately large Combine garrisons and enormous weapon caches were stationed on the advance bases, as Urizen and his forces seized worlds and continued to penetrate deeply into the Principality. In fact, by late 2333, they had actually bypassed the planet Rasalhague, having seized and subjugated New Bergen in its place. This move surprised even the Rasalhagians, who felt sure Urizen Kurita would strike for their capital. In retrospect, he should have.&#xD; In January 2334 the sons of Urizen Kurita, Victor and Isaac, made up a small part of the Draconis Combine occupation force on New Bergen. The troops there were preparing for action against the planet Outpost, but, for the moment, were enjoying an extended R&amp;R period before the next battle. During this state of lessened attention, a powerful defending force dropped onto the world and combined their might with a prearranged uprising of local citizens. In an unprecedented massacre, the defenders wiped out the occupation force to the last man. Huge stocks of armored ground vehicles, personal weapons and artillery, munitions and equipment, and even a handful of parked JumpShips were captured and quickly distributed among the Rasalhagians.&#xD; Combined with the natives' own resourcefulness and sense of economy, these new weapons provided them with a means to fight the Draconis Combine on their own terms. Thanks to the New Bergen raid, guerrilla fighting continued in the Principality of Rasalhague for three decades. In 2367 Shiro's heir, Tenno Kurita, finally declared the Rasalhague menace "vanquished," and withdrew most of the Combine's armed units present. In reality, the Principality remained officially neutral and an independent state until 2510, almost a century and a half later.&#xD; [3025] New Bergen has become one of the centers of the old Scandinavian culture,  as Rasalhague and Radstadt are both too overrun with Kurita operatives.&#xD; [3050] Major General Geston, commander of the planetary Militia, lied about the size of his force when challenged by Star Colonel Lara Ward in May 3050. As a result, Star Colonel Ward was ill prepared for the strength of New Bergen's defense. Rather than break her bid, she ordered her forces to retreat, laying ambushes as they went, and finally wore down the defenders enough to make a successful counterattack.</Description>

Founded by white South Afrikaaners of the New Calvinist sect, the world's people lived under blatantly racist rule where skin color defined social class before all other considerations. &#xD; Though the planet exported various commercial products and raw materials badly needed by many of its neighbors, many traders found it difficult to stomach doing business with the predominantly white-supremacist New Capetowners, a fact which stunted the planet's economic growth. Despite this, the world became host to a major military institution, the Royal New Capetown Military Academy.&#xD; In the mid-3030s, a concerted effort sponsored by Archon Katrina Steiner led to the toppling of the repressive government and the institution of a more egalitarian leadership to bring this world back to modern times. Though largely successful, pockets of racism still exist on New Capetown, and their effects are still felt in the halls of the RCNMA, though much of this hatred is now focused squarely on the Clans. &#xD; New Capetown's capital of New Hope (formerly New Johannesburg) is located on the southern Pretoria continent. The RCNMA, though based just outside the city, also maintains training fields on the planet's other large landmass, Eissia, in the north.</Description>

    <Description>[3067] With factories located at Dakar on New Damascus, Federated Industries is the largest producer of personal weapons and equipment in the Federated Suns. Originally founded as Federation National Firearms in 2724, it found some success with a number of handguns and long arms � enough to be bought out by no less than three different corporations in the next three decades, but not quite enough to remain a profitable subsidiary. After passing to the control of the Yorathil Corporation, though, the company struck it big with the FNF-LN rifle, the precursor to what is now known as the Federated Long Rifle.&#xD; The AFFS Department of the Quartermaster ordered 25,000 of the weapons immediately, and went on over the course of the next decade to order millions more, making it the standard long arm for its regular army infantry. Federation National Firearms became a wild success overnight, borrowing heavily on the strength of its military contracts to construct factories throughout the Federated Suns. By the time Amaris had seized control of the Terran Hegemony, the company was producing numerous weapons for the AFFS, from pistols to rifles to heavy support weapons.&#xD; The First and Second Succession Wars nearly destroyed the company, though, as weapons and ammunition factories were raided and bombed even while the AFFS needed even more weapons to prosecute those wars. With FNF production no longer able to keep up with demand, the Davion government contracted with local factories to build the exact same weapons that FNF designed. FNF came back strong in the early decades of the Third Succession War, however, with a new name and a new weapon. When Federated Arms debuted the Federated Long Rifle, the AFFS was looking for a new rifle for their infantry with better range and more hitting power. The rest, as they say, is history.&#xD; Federated Arms once more grew into a giant, ultimately entirely consuming what was left of the Yorathil Corporation and renaming the entire company to Federated Industries. The Federated Arms and Federated Armor divisions date from that time and have been the AFFS� largest supplier of small arms, support weapons, and body armor ever since. Federated Industries added Hurricane Defense Systems, a builder of heavier weapons and munitions, in 2948, expanding its business to provide every type of weapon or munitions the AFFS might need.&#xD; The purchase of Personal Defense Contractors in 2993 was, at the time, controversial. Officially, the company trained and equipped corporate security forces and personal bodyguards, and also provided those same security services to those that could afford their prices. Unofficially, the company specialized in providing elite mercenaries to petty nobles and others who sought to overthrow legitimate local rulers or engage in a truly hostile takeover. Since then, the company has become a constant performer, even in times of recession.&#xD; Federated Industries formed its final major division in 3043. For almost its entire history, the company had focused on producing conventional weapons. In fact, its only forays into lasers and other advanced weapons had been abysmal failures. Looking to turn that around and cash in on the bits of LosTech the NAIS had been unlocking every day, the company formed Federated-Barrett, initially tasking it as a high-tech R&amp;D house. This division was responsible for the very first personal Gauss weapons accepted by the AFFS, and especially the MagShot rifle integral to the Infiltrator Mk. II battle armor. As a result, in 3059 Federated-Barrett took on responsibility for not only research and development, but also production of all of Federated Industries� advanced light weapons, including Gauss weapons, lasers, and other energy weapons.</Description>

    <Description>New Delos has been the site of several historical developments. For example, it was the homeworld of Sir George Humphreys, the architect of the Free Worlds League itself. In 2531, it was the site of the conference that ended the Second Andurien War. Harlan Allison, the last member of House Allison, was killed there in 2845, and it was on New Delos that the falling-out occurred between Anton Marik and Jamie Wolf that led to Anton's Death at the hands of Wolf's Dragoons. With all these historical sites, however, there is almost no tourism on New Delos.&#xD; Part of the reason for this is the ravages of war. During the Third Succession War, the people of New Delos have been nearly reduced to subsistence levels. Under the circumstances, it is nearly impossible to build adequate tourist facilities, even if enough people could safely get to New Delos to see the sights.&#xD; This is regrettable, both because the economy would benefit enormously by the influx of M-bills and because the sweeping panoramas present some of the most breathtaking scenery in the Free Worlds. Certainly there is little value in the land itself, being almost devoid of valuable minerals and unsuited for agriculture. Without tourism, the economy of historic New Delos will remain depressed for years to come.&#xD; The capital of New Delos is Cienfuegos.&#xD; [3025] New Delos is also home to HighPoint Traders, a small corporation old enough to have a Star League trading license. HighPoint was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy five years ago when its president, Hugo Schmatz, placed in on the table during a high-stakes game of Four-Card Drax - and lost. Its new president, a scuffling rogue named Corey Chang, has managed (through a combination of hard work and fortuity) to make enough money from it to expand its operations. Much of the corporation's recent success has been the direct result of the Concord of Kapteyn, which has opened up substantial new avenues of trade between the Free Worlds League and the Capellan Confederation.&#xD; HighPoint possesses two JumpShips and seven DropShips, though most are held together with little more than prayers, bailing wire, and HarStick epoxy. Its reputation for shady dealing has only been enhanced during Chang's tenure. Nonetheless, the firm is viewed to be sufficiently reliable and has been employed by House Marik and House Orloff (as well as the Commonality of Sarna in the Capellan Confederation) to carry passengers and freight on a contract basis.&#xD; Chang is a clever but greedy man, whose grasping mind is willing to consider almost any profit-making scheme regardless of its immorality. HighPoint has been accused of smuggling, piracy, and operating unsafe vessels, and there is little doubt that these charges are true; though nothing has ever been proven in a court of law.</Description>

On December 5, 2108, the TAS Pathfinder, the first JumpShip, voyaged to Tau Ceti. Tau Ceti's forth planet was so much like Terra that it was immediately named New Earth. The glowing reports of the TAS Pathfinder's crew convinced many to colonize the planet. In 2110, New Earth became the site of the first manned scientific outside the Sol system; in 2116 it became the site of the Terran Alliance's first offworld colony.&#xD; New Earth had more than just pretty landscapes and exotic animals. Deep deposits of metals and rare chemicals soon attracted heavy industry. By the time of the Star League, New Earth was a major industrial center. Several major companies had their headquarters there. Five of them, Bergan Industries, Grumman Industries, Newhart Industries, Nicholas Spacecraft, and Ulston Armor, were major contractors for the Hegemony Armed Forces and the SLDF.&#xD; New Earth was the scene of some of the bitterest fighting in General Kerensky's campaign to recapture the Hegemony. The forces of Stefan Amaris destroyed whatever they could when it became clear that they could not hold the planet. With its grandeur and economic base destroyed, the planet's civilian population suffered greatly in the aftermath and through the Succession Wars.&#xD; The Lyran Commonwealth dominates the world today. The centuries and the gradual decline in technology have closed many of the planet's industries, but the New Earth Trading Company owns several functioning Star League-era factories, one of which manufactures extremely valuable JumpShip parts.&#xD; There has been intense activity on the New Earth continent of Conseco, sparking rumors of a huge cache of Star League artifacts.&#xD; One of the "Golden Ten" universities of the Star League, the New Earth university concentrated on the care and running of commercial spaceships. Because of this, the university was divided into two campuses, A large space station served as the university's Jumpship and Dropship training center, and the second campus was an academic center. Neither school survived the forces of the Rim Worlds Republic.&#xD; New Earth's southern continent was settled by a loose coalition from among eight of the surviving Amerindian tribes of North America. The people's nation established a federation dedicated to preserving and continuing the ways of life of their ancestors.&#xD; [3025] New Earth is also home to the St. Rethwin's College for Theological Studies, the largest and most prestigious privately funded seminary in the Lyran Commonwealth. For the past 400 years, this seminary has grown to cover instruction in not one, but 20 different Christian and non-Christian traditions.</Description>

This novel concept provided neighboring governments a suitable stage for military contests across New Hessen's vast plains and mountains, without the risk of spoiling their own lands. &#xD; The enormous profits gleaned from these enterprises allowed the von Hesse family to establish the largest military-industrial complex in the Tikonov Union.

They also offer ready-made "shopping-centers" for the recruitment o new MechWarriors for Capellan mercenary units.

Industries looking to exploit the planet's mineral, chemical, and metal wealth flocked to New Home and set up shop with scores of hopeful young settlers looking to eke out a living on a brave new world. &#xD; The large, pole-to-pole supercontinent of Spina Planetia, dominated by a central mountain chain called the Great Spine Mountains, drew the majority of the new colonists, who established cities and mining operations along the coastal regions and mountain bases. Many more, however, found the two secondary continents of Goldwynn and Arbergeiht, both located in the southern hemisphere, equally suitable for habitation, and there they set up smaller towns and agricultural communities. Findler, the capital city, was built on the northeastern plains of Spina Planetia, facing the eastern Tomagasso Ocean. Mann, site of the planet's largest spaceport, was established 700 kilometers to the south. &#xD; When the Terran Hegemony placed New Home under its aegis, the world's strategic location, so close to Terra, necessitated the placement of an elaborate space defense network on the planet and in orbit around it. Much to the SLDF's dismay, this network fell under the control of the Usurper's troops when the Amaris crisis began, and the entire marvel of Star League military engineering had to be destroyed in the campaign to liberate Terra.&#xD; Ruled by the Capellans after the fall of the League, New Home was frequently raided by the Free Worlds League and the Federated Suns, and ultimately became part of the Federated Commonwealth after the Fourth Succession War. When the Commonwealth fractured in 3057, New Home was left without any direction and fell into anarchy.</Description>

Less than a jump away from the Combine border, the world of New Ivaarsen has been the object of conquest dozens of times throughout centuries of hostilities between the Combine and the Federated Suns. Following the Suns' final recapture of New Ivaarsen almost two centuries ago, the world's new duke began to organize his private guard.&#xD; As New Ivaarsen's farming and manufacturing industries recovered and began to grow, the Stephenson family's wealth likewise increased, prompting the duke to expand his private guard. By the beginning of this century, the New Ivaarsen Chasseurs had grown to two full BattleMech regiments, in addition to supporting elements. Though the Second was almost destroyed by the Jade Falcons during the initial months of the Clan invasion, Prince Victor ordered the regiment rebuilt in 3060 in recognition of the Chasseurs' many years of devotion to the Federated Suns.&#xD; The Chasseurs units are technically part of the AFFC, though the Stephenson family was accorded a number of privileges in deference to their years of fanatical loyalty to the Federated Suns. At least one of the Chasseur regiments has remained on New Ivaarsen since their attachment to the AFFS, and the Duke has the right to quash any Chasseur assignment he objects to (unless ordered by the rightful Prince, a technicality Duke Leto has used at least once since Archon Katherine's assumption of the throne on New Avalon). Additionally, the Chasseurs are under the direct authority of the High Command, though for practical purposes Chasseur officers routinely coordinate with the commanders on Le Blanc and Robinson.</Description>

    <Description>Visitors to New Kyoto are often struck by the heavy Japanese influence in the local culture. Indeed, this exotic � yet terrestrial � world once boasted itself as a major center of the Buddhist faith in the Lyran Commonwealth, and the temple in Tooshodai-ji possesses the Inner Sphere�s largest Amida Buddha sculpture (over 110 meters in height). These obvious cultural influences have often led travelers to New Kyoto to suspect that the planet�s history includes a lingering occupation or long-standing allegiance to the Draconis Combine but, in fact, neither of the above applies. &#xD; Settled during humanity�s first exodus into space, New Kyoto�s colonists hailed from Terra�s eastern Asia region, particularly from the nations surrounding the Sea of Japan. The Japanese segment of the colonial population, by far the most numerous, took an active role in shaping the early social structures on this world, even going so far as to style the planetary ruler a Daimyo (warlord). Life in the early days was difficult, primarily due to the virulence of native life-forms. Many of New Kyoto�s fiercest native predators, such as the vicious ki-rian or the unstoppable armor bear, claimed hundreds of lives before widespread hunting protocols brought their numbers under control. &#xD; Even today, people are strongly advised never to travel alone and unarmed in the wild reaches of this world, and export of the local fauna is strictly prohibited. New Kyoto�s ample resources and fertile soil spawned the formation of numerous heavy industries, including the development of myomers, advanced electronics, and military-grade lasers. The Kyoto College, exclusively devoted to the study of myomer technology for military as well as medical applications, was arguably one of the most prestigious of its kind throughout the Succession Wars era, while Doering Electronics and RAMTech Industries were once among the chief military suppliers to the Federation of Skye and the Lyran Commonwealth.&#xD; Through the centuries of conflict that followed the fall of the Star League, New Kyoto was the target of several raids by the nearby Free Worlds League, though it has remained always remained a Lyran holding.&#xD; New Kyoto�s capital city of Hirihito and the temple of Tooshodai-ji are both located on the northern continent of Asharu. The city of Yonei is located on Kalasaka, the larger of the planet�s equatorial landmasses, along with one of the largest planetary reservations for the now-endangered ki-rian population. Koshimatu, the smaller equatorial continent, is home to RAMTech�s corporate headquarters, in the city of Oshaktu, while Kawnaku and Marker Electronics may be found on the southern island continent of Zuishami.</Description>

    <Description>During the 22nd century, this fertile planet was settled by a half-dozen waves of colonists, who battled one another over land and water rights. In both 2196 and 2220, Terran Alliance military forces had to intervene to halt these conflicts. After the fall of the Alliance, the population formed three republics, Olympica, Kasnov, and New Greenland, which immediately went to war with each other.&#xD; In 2265, the latter two accepted Alonzo Marik's proposal to join the fledgling Marik Commonwealth. The ruling D'Andre family of Olympica, however, declined the Marik's overtures. With the aid of a naval contingent from Regulus (which was contending with the Marik's over spheres of influence), Olympica managed to secure recognition as an independent state - a status it retains to this say.&#xD; Though virtually all the agri-domes that once dotted New Olympica's landscape have been damaged or destroyed by the Succession Wars, the planet remains an important agricultural exporter to other League worlds. Its seas remain abundantly stocked with marine life, including marlin, sea bass, speckled hoodoo, and Hodson's Fliers (a unique breed whose members can grow to over four meters and can leap more than ten meters out of the water).&#xD; New Olympia also houses two of the League's military academies: the Allison MechWarrior Institute and the Lloyd Marik-Stanley Aerospace School.&#xD; Situated outside the city of Darienbad on New Olympia, barely two hundred miles from the Lloyd Marik-Stanley Aerospace School, the Allison MechWarrior Institute is the League's premier MechWarrior academy. As the academy is one of the few MechWarrior-only schools in the League open to all applicants, competition for places is fierce. The Captain-General himself makes the final selection of all candidates - though Thomas Marik shows less political bias than his father in this process, he continues to use his right to control over these desirable positions as political leverage.&#xD; The academy graduates 375 MechWarriors each year, roughly 75% of its annual enrolment. As a top producer of MechWarriors, AMI fosters a strong rivalry with the nearby Aerospace School; cadets from both institutions buy into the stereotypical rivalry commonly encouraged between MechWarriors and aerospace pilots.&#xD; Situated in the New Greenland Mountains (nicknamed the "Gardens of the Gods"), the Lloyd Marik-Stanley Aerospace School trains the bulk of the League's aerospace and naval personnel. For nearly five hundred years the institute has trained fighter pilots as well as DropShip and JumpShip crews. The school's WarShip program was suspended following the loss of the League's last two WarShips, the FWLS Pleiades and Arcturas, in the early days of the Second Succession War, but the academy retained its sophisticated naval training simulators. When rumors of WarShips in the fleets of the Clan invaders began to circulate in 3050, the school dusted off its manuals and revived its WarShip training course.&#xD; Beginning in 3054, the school resumed its full naval training program, at first cross-training JumpShip and DropShip crews and later providing specialist courses. LMS graduates have gone on to command the League's nascent fleet of WarShips, and the school is looking for ways to increase the number of graduates from this program.</Description>

    <Description>[3025] The city of Camden is home to the head office of Galileo Instruments. Beginning as a manufacturer of control equipment for spacecraft, Galileo diversified into sophisticated electronic systems for a variety of applications. Former CEO Phillip Diashai had a minor failing-out with the military procurement board about the time the government was splitting into military and civilian divisions. Diashai chose to give up the guidance systems section of the firm in order to remain civilian. &#xD; The company has overcome the financial setback of losing 60 percent of its line, and now excels at producing electronic equipment and an innovative line of agricultural electronics, most notably the Automatic Self-Harvesting Hydroponics Farm.&#xD; [3050] New Oslo was a key world for the Wolves because it was the site of the only functioning BattleMech factory in the FRR. A lack of frontline troops for the assault forced Khan Ulric Kerensky to take a great risk and deploy members of the Veteran Guards as the invasion force for this target in July 3050.&#xD; The Wolf forces of the Green Keshik, Trinaries Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and twentieth (of Epsilon Galaxy's Dorbeng Cluster) fought pitched battles at Lillehammer and at Ringsaker Valley, just kilometers away from the prized 'Mech Factory. The First New Olso Armored Division and the GKT Volunteer Regiment (Archer and Panther 'Mechs from the GKT factory piloted by retirees and veterans), fought well against the Wolves, but the Veteran Guards did not disappoint their Khan. The defenders did buy enough time for the majority of the factory to be dismantled and relocated prior to its capture.</Description>

    <Description>New Rhodes III is a small, mostly desert world, unremarkable except for two things. First, because of its small star, the travel time between New Rhodes III and its jump point is very quick. With such short turnaround times, New Rhodes III became a crucial resupply world during the First Succession War and was fought over several times. However, it is the Colossii that truly sets New Rhodes III apart; luckily, none of the chain was touched during any of the Succession Wars. Found in 2259 by the first colonists, these huge rock pillars-approximately one hundred fifty in the chain, which runs in a snaking pattern from deep within the central desert on the continent of Crete, terminating right at the edge of the equatorial ocean-have been scientific oddities for centuries. &#xD; Geologists speculate that a meteor-in all likelihood several meteors-from outside the galaxy impacted on New Rhodes some two million year ago, bringing chemicals and minerals completely foreign to the planet. After millennia of wind erosion and harsh desert climate mixed to reveal the minerals trapped in the ground, the Colossii revealed themselves in all their wonder and splendor; there are colors found in these rocks that have literally not been found on a single other colonized world. As word slowly spread, New Rhodes III became a pleasure destination from across the Inner Sphere, resulting in the small capital of Xerxes being established near the southern end of the Colossii chain. However, because of the harsh conditions of most of the rest of the planet-the continents of Minos and Sparta are almost unlivable-New Rhodes III is permanent home to only desert nomads and a small scientific community; the "capital" is home almost exclusively to said community.</Description>

The Commandoes overran the garrison forces on New Roland in little under sixteen hours, smashing the armor and infantry force for the loss of one �Mech (and that to a mechanical breakdown). Two days after her troops landed on the world, Major Pali Fitzengraber received New Roland�s surrender and officially declared it part of the Magistracy of Canopus.&#xD; [3034] The final battle of the Andurien war on Capellan soil took place on New Roland in November 3034, with the much-lauded House Dai Da Chi and Kamakura�s Hussars facing off against Clayborne�s Commandoes and the battered remnants of Task Force Duo. The brutal and devastating attack by the CCAF troops was almost too effective � the Cuirassiers cohesion disintegrated, and only a valiant rearguard action by the Second Fusiliers and the core of the Cuirassiers (including Emma Centrella) allowed the Canopian force to escape. It would take three months of operations before the last of the Canopians were driven off-world, effectively ending the war.</Description>

    <Description>Settled in the early days of the Exodus, New Samarkand was once the administrative and mercantile capital of the Draconis Combine. However, when Sanethia moved the capital to Luthien, the planet decayed. Now, havens of pirates and thieves inhabit its crumbling mansions and cities. &#xD; In spite of this (or because of it), New Samarkand is the home of the Internal Security Force and its Internal Security College. Curricula include such relevant classes as Phys Ed 204 (Using Martial Arts to Inspire Terror, Death, and Loyalty) and Psych 103 (An Introduction to Brainwashing, Interrogation, and Paranoia). The list of students is classified, as knowing the identity of future agents is a crime against the state.&#xD; The Internal Security College is isolated and well-protected. Surrounding the grounds are 60 kilometers of diacetylsilicate, a sand that eats away metal, rubber, and flesh. Any aircraft within 200 kilometers is shot down without warning. The ISC works hard to ensure that they have no visitors or deserters.&#xD; A few manufacturing concerns still operate on New Samarkand, including New Samarkand Metals and IndoTronics Incorporated. These concerns operate in enclosed fortifications, where their employees also live. Armed guards patrol the borders to ensure that no undesirables attempt to invade the area for supplies.&#xD; The city of Garden, on New Samarkand, is headquarters to New Samarkand Metals. "If it's metal, its Samarkand" is the motto of this fast-growing concern. When planetary losses and transportation difficulties threatened the supply of ores for steel-making, Samarkand moved ahead with research on alternate metals. Though their Tempered Samarkite alloy is a little more difficult to work with than steel, it has proven to be equally strong. The actual formula for Samarkite is guarded as closely as the Coordinator.&#xD; New Samarkand is perhaps best known as home to the Sun Zhang Mechwarrior Academy. The abandoned cities provide an excellent training ground for Mechwarrior and Aerospace Fighter Pilots to practice the intricacies of city fighting.&#xD; Tamarlane melon from New Samarkand is considered a delicacy in the Draconis Combine.</Description>

    <HasFactory>false</HasFactory>
    <Description>The unremarkable world of New St. Andrews, is barely visited even by those looking to prey on their fellow man. The history of the world lies in some of the earliest days of the Free World's League. Among the many smaller nations the League gobbled up was the Stewart Confederation, a nation whose people descended almost exclusively from Scotsmen native to the Terran British Isles. Rather than bow their will to the league, quite a few of the Confederation's people found sanctuary in the Rim Worlds Republic, where they were actually accorded a significant level of freedom. Of course, they only lasted until Stefan Amaris launched his bloody coup on the Star League. Again the expatriates of the Stewart Confederation were turned into refugees looking for a new home, this time by General Kerensky's assault upon Amaris' Republic.&#xD; They eventually came upon the world they called New St. Andrews and set out to forge a new life from themselves. With the confusion wrought by the Star League war against Amaris, history simply lost track of the refugees for quite a number of years. The expatriates, when they fled the Rim Worlds Republic, had the opportunity to gather only a few supplies and little technology, so when they reached New St. Andrews, they were forced to turn to the livelihood of their forefathers to survive - farming and herding.&#xD; Of course, the failings of humanity overcame them as they did every other independent nation  in history. In the case of these four Scottish Clans - Brannigan, MacGregor, Sterling and Stewart - the precedent had already been set many centuries before. While each of the four extended families settled a different section of the planet, they soon came into conflict with each other, oftentimes over the simplest of matters. That they had no way to replicate the weapons of mass destruction that were ravaging the Inner Sphere at the time was the only reason they did not destroy one another.&#xD; Fortunately for the people of New St. Andrews, the leaders of Clans MacGregor and Stewart eventually saw the larger picture. They realized that if they continued on with their feuding, they would wither wipe themselves out completely or would again fall to one of the Periphery's many powers, several of whom had by then sent expeditions to the world. The two Clans united, building a new and thriving society together. Of course, they did so realizing that both Clans Brannigan and Sterling, reduced to mere husks of what they once had been, would undoubtedly turn their attentions toward them, jealous of their prosperity.&#xD; That did happen, with the survivors of the other two Clans commonly going to any lengths to steal what they needed or destroy it, lest anyone else be able to use it. Because of the preparations of the two stronger Clans, none of the attacks have yet caused any significant harm to the planet's economy. Both the MacGregors and the Stewarts are committed to rebuilding ties with their fallen brothers. It is a stark irony, considering the parallels that can be drawn to both the state of matters in the Periphery as well as the rest of the Inner Sphere.&#xD; Since the bonding of the two Clans, New St. Andrews population has steadily climbed and, though not on par with even the standard throughout the Periphery, its level of technology no longer relies completely on manual labor and beasts of burden. Unfortunately, that advancement comes with a price. Once considered nothing more than an agricultural world where Periphery wanderers could replenish their water supplies and possibly gather some local food, New St. Andrews is becoming more and more of a target for pirates and raiders.</Description>

    <HasFactory>true</HasFactory>
    <Description>New Syrtis is a large world in the grip of an ice age. Huge sheets of ice have covered most of the planet, leaving only a narrow band of temperate and tropical weather around the equator. New Syrtis was first discovered during the era of the Terran Alliance, but was not colonized until the late 2260s. Those that did finally settle here were hoping to get rich by discovering deposits of precious metals and minerals said to be hidden beneath all the ice and snow. The gamble paid off when the first settlers found large deposits of metals scattered all over the planet.&#xD; New Syrtis became a boom world overnight. Thousands made their way here in hopes of striking it rich. After months of solitary struggle, the miners would trudge their way from the ice and snow with tons of ore and the urge to raise a little hell. Cities like Pink Passion, Lady's Favor, and Hangover Hell began to sprout in the temperate zone. They had only one function-to strip the miners of their wealth in the quickest possible fashion. The deposits of easily mined metals soon played out and the boom was over. Well-organized mining corporations then moved in to mine the deeper deposits, which spelled the end of the independent miner and the raucous sin-cities.&#xD; It was at about this time that New Syrtis was entitled to the Hasek family. Always an intelligent, though not particularly scrupulous, family, the Haseks slowly won a stranglehold over the planet's resources. They were able to rein the avarice of the metal companies, who would have stripped away huge chunks of the surface - nearly destroying the planet's fragile ecosystem - in their search for profits. Whether the Haseks did this out of concern for their world or the desire to own all of its wealth is not certain. What is certain is that their policies have resulted in rationing of the vast metal and mineral wealth of the planet over the centuries, with New Syrtis as important to the Federated Suns today as it was in an earlier era.&#xD; Because of its importance, New Syrtis is the frequent target ot attacks by the nearby Capellan Confederation. When under attack, the planet has as its fearsome ally the almost constant blizzards and bone-freezing cold spells. It has been estimated that one out of every five invading Capellan 'Mechs and tanks is lost because it runs afoul of the weather.&#xD; The defensive advantage of the arctic climate is one of the reasons why the Hasek family decided to build their capital city, Saso, on the northern continent instead of the more temperate equator region. The city is in some ways reminiscent of Avalon City, with the Hasek palace set upon a small complex of hills overlooking the city and with the University of Saso nearby. The current Duke of New Syrtis, Michael Hasek-Davion, would like to see Saso University out distance the New Avalon Institute of Science. Near the university and hidden underground beneath the perpetual snow is the Regional Military Headquarters, where Duke Michael coordinates the military activity of the entire Capellan March.&#xD; Situated at Lagrange Point 4, the New Syrtis Shipyards, formerly the main repair work site for JumpShips and DropShips, have been sealed off since June 3022. Moreover, all inquiries about what is happening there are strongly discouraged. Three armed DropShips and a number of AeroSpace Fighters are on constant patrol to see that no unauthorized person approaches the shipyards. There is also a constant flow of coded communications between the shipyards and the New Avalon Institute of Science. Even the wildest speculation as to what is going on at the New Syrtis Shipyards may turn out to be plausible.</Description>

This is especially discouraging because of rumors that the company's research division was on the verge of developing a wheat-type grain that could grow in soil with high mineral and salt contents. The Davion government is privately considering bailing out NVAC  because the firm has always been in the forefront of agricultural sciences.&#xD; [3025] GM/Blackwell maintains an assembly plant here for the feared Marauder II on New Valencia.

The site of bitter fighting during the Reunification War and center of a harsh post-war occupation, its inhabitants have sworn to prevent their world from ever being occupied again. Accordingly, the Taurians have established a large permanent garrison backed by an extensive array of fortifications on the planet.&#xD; At present, New Vandenburg supports a population of well over a billion and the largest Taurian war material industry outside the Hyades Cluster. In addition, the planet is known for its rich variety of rare and exotic avian life-forms, many of which remain protected in secure nature reserves in the planet's southern hemisphere.&#xD; [3025] Alone of all the Periphery states, the Taurian Concordat maintains large military training academies. At present, there is one academy for each major combat branch: the Army, Navy, and AeroSpace Arms. The army training academy is the �cole Militaire, located on Taurus. The Taurian Naval Institute and the Concordat AeroSpace Flight School are located on New Vandenburg and Samantha, respectively. Each has a well-developed training program for both NCOs and officers and can accommodate upward of five hundred personnel.&#xD; The Concordat has also retained the highest literacy rate in the Periphery. Indeed, the Taurian educational system has served as a model for other states, including those of the Inner Sphere. Despite losing many educational institutions during the Reunification War, the Taurians have rebuilt their schools to pre-Star League levels, since regaining their independence. They can now boast no fewer than six universities. Located on Taurus, Samantha, Pinard, New Vandenburg, MacLeod's Land, and Euschelus, these universities graduate an average of over forty thousand students annually.</Description>

In the First Succession War, Lyran troops attempting to seize the planet launched a blitzkrieg spearheaded by a small fleet of light WarShips. &#xD; Intending to launch a barrage at the major cities, in hopes of eliminating all opposition outright, the Lyran fleet was instead surprised by the arrival of a Combine naval force to intercept them. In the orbital battle that followed, one Lyran battleship, crippled by a devastating broadside attack, spun into the planet's atmosphere, where its fusion reactors lost containment and exploded before the safeguards could engage, spilling toxic levels of radiation into the sky and raining flaming debris across the western coastline of Jarichosia, New Wessex's northernmost continent. &#xD; Though no Lyran forces landed on New Wessex that day, the aftermath of the assault was profound, and even today incidence of lung and skin cancer on this planet remain higher than the local average. Through the following centuries, New Wessex was raided several times by Lyran forces, but the biggest engagement fought on New Wessex in the wars that followed the Star league's fall happened in 3021, when the famous Wolf's Dragoons mercenary unit spearheaded a Lyran attack against Combine troops massing here for an impending assault on the Commonwealth. &#xD; The massive battle, fought in and around Harlow's Wood and the capital city of Hallanan on the southern continent, Lancombe, lasted only a week, but the legends around it remain in the hearts and minds of the native "Wessexans" today, and a cottage industry has grown around tourism based on that famous battle.&#xD; New Wessex is sparsely inhabited, with most of the population living in towns and cities scattered on the coastlines of the Lancombe, Jarichosia, and Toridine continents, while the south polar continent of Thelios, covered completely by a glacial ice shelf that touches the southern reaches of Lancombe, has yet to be fully explored.</Description>

    <Description>Named after a provincial capital from the northeast Zhejiang province in China on Terra, Ningpo was a temperate world of fertile ground and beautiful seas. The planet became a moderate supplier of many agricultural products to worlds like Pleione and Poznan. &#xD; Ningpo has two major continents and many islands that are home to many of the exotic birds on the planet. The continent of Qingyuan covers most of the northern hemisphere, and is composed of 85 percent farmland with rolling hills and dales. Ningbo, the planetary capital, is located on the southeast coast of the continent. Liampo, the smaller of the two continents, is located in the equatorial region, extending into the southern hemisphere.&#xD; Liampo is the more industrialized of the two, though 45 percent of it is covered by farmland, much like Qingyuan. One of the most beautiful places on the planet is Qingyuan's Yalosha Peninsula. Located on the southwest coast, Yalosha is large peninsula flanked by a large mountain range called Yalo Rue. The mountains and the peninsula are covered with lush green forests that the timber industry has been selectively farming and using to produce some of the most beautiful furniture in the Inner Sphere. It is rumored that the Celestial Throne of the Capellan Confederation is made of Ningpo timber. &#xD; During the Fourth Succession War, one of the elite regiments of the Northwind Highlanders fought the Third Davion Guards to a standstill before they were allowed to retire to Northwind.</Description>

    <Description>A small agricultural planet, Ningxia has only one large city - New Zephyus. situated on a rocky, forest-covered island in the planets only ocean, New Zephyus is well-known throughout the Combine for the beauty of its ukiyo. The saying is that on Nigxia, one can satisfy ones hunger, and in New Zephyus, one can satisfy all ones aesthetic and sensual desires.&#xD; The Planet has benefited from this reputation.  Even though Ningxia has large diamond deposits worth millions, many highly placed politicians, including the present Coordinator, want the planet to retain its pristine, pastoral beauty. Many rich politicians and business leaders have houses along the shore of the ocean.&#xD; Ningxia supports a large spaceport on an island near New Zephyus.  Because this ancient facilities machinery chronically breaks down, there have been several major disasters in recent years. The machinery needed to repair the facility is better to needy worlds.  Ningxia Foods, a major food-producing company on the planet, has resorted to having its freighters land directly on its farms to load up cargo. This has angered many people, who worry that other companies will copy the practice, eventually marring the world with scorched earth, noxious fumes, and toxic wastes.&#xD; [3067] During Operation Bulldog, the Ryuken-roku helped capture Courchevel and Luzerne from the Smoke Jaguars. After the campaign, the Ryuken-roku was abruptly reassigned assigned to Ningxia at the request of the Coordinator, who code-named the assignment Kitsune Shield. The Combine�s recent conflicts have not warranted the recall of this unit to any of the hot spots along its borders, and the regiment remains in place on Ningxia.</Description>

    <HasFactory>false</HasFactory>
    <Description>Nirasaki was settled by communal idealists who hoped to create a perfect society, in which everyone would live in harmony in the virtual absence of government or a policing force. The experiment was only partially successful, as infighting between settlers and the early colonists' insistence on barter-based trade made it difficult to deal with other worlds for needed goods. Eventually, a basic planetary government, structured as a loose coalition of the various communes on Kalifax and Ouanii, Nirasaki's two largest continents, was established. &#xD; Based on democratic principles, the Nirasaki government required a simple majority vote for any decisions affecting a planetary region or interplanetary relations and helped create a basic planetary economy based on work credits and a standard for determining the relative values of products and services. Beyond these basic functions, which included an emergency powers clause in case of an external threat, the Nirasaki government had no other authority. Farms, cattle ranches, fishing communities and artistic communes made up the bulk of Nirasaki's population until the rise of the Star League. Though Nirasaki was left to its semi-anarchistic government under the Hegemony, the planet began to draw the attention of entrepreneurs. However, few corporate entities could make headway on Nirasaki, due to lax government practices and the work credits system, until the native Nirasaki Computers Collective was founded in the large Blue Heron Commune. &#xD; The NCC developed computer systems of astonishing efficiency and quality, including the famous Blue Lotus personal computer line, which was cutting edge in the Star League's day. For this reason, the Hegemony contracted the NCC to develop software for use in the Space Defense Systems throughout its holdings. As it happened, the NCC did its job too well in this regard. When the Amaris coup took place, the brightest minds of the Collective were forcibly relocated to Terra, and their work pitted the liberating SLDF forces against SDS networks that used some of the most sophisticated pseudo-artificial intelligence ever produced. It wasn't until years later, when returning SLDF forces uncovered technical specs hidden away for their benefit in the abandoned NCC headquarters, that their artful programming was defeated and the worlds Amaris had turned into deadly gauntlets were retaken.&#xD; Though the NCC itself never revived after the fall of the League, its former offices and production facilities were eventually taken over by Blue Heron Computers, today a major producer of the Blue Lotus portable compads and noteputers used throughout the Inner Sphere. Nirasaki's government is more utilitarian now, a result of centuries under the Dragon's rule. It includes a planetary police force and a local militia, both based in the capital city of Elusian on the Kalifax continent. The Blue Heron Commune, one of the many cities that still hold to the traditions of communal existence, is located on the southern peninsula of Ouanii. Nirasaki's third major landmass, Arkatis, is in the planet's south polar region and is home to the Nirasaki Communications Community, a planetwide information and entertainment company based in the city of Arkatis' Unity.&#xD; Nirasaki is one of the plush resort worlds frequently visited by Combine nobility, and is also one of the official 28 worlds of the Riviera-style gambling �Circuit� for anyone able to obtain visitors� permits. Nirasaki also hosts the annual Hiyake solar yacht races, the premier event in that sport.</Description>

    <Description>Nopah's swollen, dying parent star has been a blessing to its flora, but all of the planet's native animal life has perished due to dramatic changes in Nopah's climate. Settlers from Terra recognized Nopah's agricultural potential but had to introduce their own insects to ensure that their crops were fertilized. &#xD; After the fall of the First Star League, Nopah joined the Federated Suns. It remained under the flag of the Federated Suns until the Third Succession War, when Warrior House units from the Capellan Confederation managed to capture Nopah in 2905. By a stroke of luck, the Confederation and the Federated Suns signed a temporary armistice ceasing military action along their entire border a few months later. The Confederation held Nopah for 25 years until 2930, when the Federated Suns decided to break the armistice.&#xD; During the Fourth Succession War, the Federated Suns leaked false reports of unguarded military supply depots and communications facilities on Nopah and several other border worlds. Reeling from House Davion's offensive, the Capellan Confederation focused its few counterattacks on these worlds. But the Capellans found no supplies, only front-line house and mercenary regiments from the Federated Suns. No less than three regiment-sized battles took place on Nopah, involving famous units like McCarron's Armored Cavalry, the Ceti Hussars, the Vegan Rangers, and the Capellan Hussars. To this day, BattleMech and tank wreckage litters hills and fields around the towns of Grinsanders, Stongton's Crossing, and White Hall.&#xD; Nopah has three major continents; Nen, Nin, and Non. The planet's capital of Cocula, is situated on Nin.</Description>

The fact that they can be hawked or shown for gain is merely a profitable side-benefit.&#xD; Some art forms rise above the profit motive, however. The Park of �Mechs on Norfolk covers several square kilometers, and recreates major historical battles with eighth-scale BattleMechs, allowing visitors from all over the Inner Sphere to walk amongst them to whilst appearing almost the same size.&#xD; [3055] For many years the League experienced a chronic shortage of PPCs and substituted large lasers for the more effective particle weapons.

    <Description>Northwind was founded in the early years of space exploration by Scots, Irish, and Welsh colonists, who found the temperate, foggy world very much like their homelands on Terra. Clan Stuart, one of the more prominent groups among these colonists, also brought with them a small parade company that descended from the military forces of ancient Scotland. Over time, this company ultimately grew into the famed Northwind Highlanders mercenary regiment, after the Elders of Northwind elected to form a standing defense force, starting with the Kearny Highlanders (named after Kearny, a northern mining settlement).&#xD; After the collapse of the Star League, Northwind was fought over mostly by the forces of Houses Davion and Liao, both of whom used the world as a bargaining chip in securing the employment of the Highlanders. In 3057, after the breakup of the Federated Commonwealth, Northwind - and its famed Highlanders - finally won its independence from both realms. Today, the people of Northwind still cling to their Scottish, Irish, and Welsh roots, and their world is home to the Northwind Military Academy, on the continent of New Lanark, along with the planetary capital city of Tara.&#xD; The largest of Northwind's continents, New Lanark is also home to "The Castle," an old Star League-era fortification on the Tilman River. The industrial mining city of Kearny is located on Northwind's second-largest landmass, of the same name, while a third continent, Halidon, surrounded by the Falkirk Sea and the Argyle Islands, is home to a secondary spaceport and an annex of the Northwind Military Academy focused on aerospace combat.</Description>

    <Description>"Often it is Fate, not tactics or strategy that determines the site of great battles. From Waterloo and Gettysberg to New Vandenberg and Kentares, the critical military moment all too frequently comes at a time and place that few expect...and leaves behind a dreadful legacy." These words, penned by a House Davion historian in 2798 about the Kentares Massacre, also apply to Nova Roma. Settled during the good years of the Star League by the Indrus Corporation, the planet remained a modestly successful, rather sleepy agrarian world for four centuries. Because of its utter lack of strategic importance, it even escaped attack from enemy forces during the Succession Wars. In 3014, however, Nova Roma's luck finally ran out.&#xD; In September of that year, elements of Wolf's Dragoons landed on Nova Roma and easily subdued the garrison of Free Worlds Guards stationed there. Later that autumn, Duke Anton delivered an incendiary address from Nova Roma, surrounded by the smiling faces of the planet's Executive Council (who had been rounded up by bayonet for the occasion). The vidtape of this event was broadcast to Loyalist Marik forces, raising their ire. Thus, when Anton's forces regrouped on Nova Roma for their final stand, Janos's advancing armies laid waste to many farms and mines during the pursuit of the enemy.&#xD; This damage decimated Nova Roma's economy, which may not recover without outside help. However, the crisis does not concern the planet's governor, Stanton de Beer, who spends most of his time assiduously checking out every rumor of rebellion. In the meantime, the planet's Executive Council is powerless to do anything but smile at the new faces holding the same bayonets.&#xD; The Marik Civil War also provided the backdrop for the first infamous run-in between the Bounty Hunter and Natasha Kerensky. Both the Hunter and Kerensky were hunting those still loyal to Janos Marik when the Bounty Hunter turned on the Widow, leaving her for dead and claiming her Marauder, which he took over as his own signature BattleMech. Kerensky lived through the ordeal and vowed to exact vengeance (some even say she somehow got her hands on his Warhammer and began to use that as her trademark �Mech).</Description>

    <Description>Refugees fleeing from a Kuritan incursion into the Outworlds Alliance first settled the world of Novo Franklin in 2598. Looking for a new world to call their own, these refugees found a world rich in water and arable land, two details that became a beacon call throughout the region. As more and more refugees made their way to this world, dozens of farms and agricultural concerns sprouted up across the planet. Few major communities sprung up on the world, however. Its inhabitants were content to simply work the land and trade with each other for whatever they needed.&#xD; Within just a few years of its colonization, a social pecking order of sorts developed on Novo Franklin. Several powerful families gobbled up less productive farms, while dozens of smaller concerns banded together into co-ops to keep themselves from being taken over. When the chaos was over, the leaders of these fifty or so major farms had tightened their grips over their own territories. Within a decade of Novo Franklin's colonization, each had become the warlord of a miniature city-state.&#xD; Even with these problems plaguing the word, news of the great successes and bountiful lands there brought more and more hopefuls to Novo Franklin. Some paid their own way to the world while others were brought with the promise of a change to shape their own life. Nearly all ended up working the farms, indentured to the world's ruling families.&#xD; Remarkably little has changed since those early years, with a constant state of war existing between the various farms/city-states. Just as eras of war and peace, prosperity and depression swept through the Inner Sphere, so too did they wrack Novo Franklin. Alliances were made and broken, wars were won and lost, and revolutions came and went. Technology that had reached parity with the Inner Sphere was suddenly reduced to ashes by petty neighbors. In fact, Novo Franklin's history closely resembles that of half a dozen worlds throughout the Inner Sphere - though on a microscopic scale. The only significant difference, in that being that alone amongst the stars, Novo Franklin never had the economic and military might of an interstellar power to pull it back from the brink of collapse.&#xD; Today, the world continues to exist as it has for centuries, as a result of measures employed by the ruling class to preserve the neofeudal system. The planet's isolation has undoubtedly been a major factor in their success. That isolation, and the fact that Novo Franklin contains only a single, small spaceport, has enabled the planet's ruling class to closely monitor and control all contact the planet's working class have with the outside universe. The ruling class also prohibits workers from educating their offspring. Any worker who displays the ability to read and write or who teaches such abilities may be executed under the planet's laws. The rulers educate their own offspring of course, to ensure that their families continue to maintain their dominant positions within Franklinian society.&#xD; Even the education of the "gentry" class is far below the standard set by many nations, though, due to its limited access to outside information. The overall standard of living is actually relatively high, a fact directly attributable to the world's agricultural bounty. On the other hand, many within the working/peasant class are clearly dissatisfied with the way they are treated by their leaders. Though the punishment for revolt is swift and final, the people of three different city-states have successfully overthrown their warlords. This has naturally led to a growing popular uprising on the world, one that many of the militias on Novo Franklin are having increasing difficulty in putting down. For now, the ruling families still maintain their hold over the world, though that grip is growing ever more tenuous as the days pass.</Description>

Archon Michael Steiner's company of 'Mechs and heavy tanks moved against an equal number of House Kurita's 'Mechs from a Sword of Light regiment. In a three-hour engagement against the notoriously tenacious Kurita forces, the Archon's troops fought their way into the enemy's rear areas. They then fanned out into lance-sized units to cause as much damage as possible to in the enemy's supply and communication centers.    &#xD; Michael Steiner's command lance fought its way to the enemy's regimental headquarters. There, the former Archon managed to destroy the HQ, killing the commanding officer and staff before being killed by Kurita 'Mech reinforcements.&#xD; Though this Kurita attack was neither successful nor strategically significant, it marked a major turning point in armed warfare. The few confrontations in military history that compare to it include the Monitor-vs.-Merrimack engagement in March, 1862 and the Battle of Coral Sea in May, 1942.&#xD; Nox is also the headquarters of Metals of the Earth, based in the city of Jassen. Dating back to the Star League era, when it was a medium-sized mining firm, Metals of the Earth now also manufactures mining equipment, chemicals and synthetics, including myomers.&#xD; Metals of the Earth has always been closely tied to the Kurita family. One of the original founding partners was a Kurita, and there has always been at least one Kurita on the Board of Directors. It is no surprise that Metals of the Earth gets the majority of valuable government contracts.&#xD; [3052] Clan Wolf landed on Nox in February 3052.

    <Description>High-grade silicon and other minerals valuable to the electronics industry made the dim, cool world of Nusakan a natural center for the computer and electronics trades, despite its low water supply and the inhospitality of its northern and southern tundra. By the time of the Star League, this planet - jointly administered by the Lyran Commonwealth and the Terran Hegemony - was a heavily industrialized world, with such major corporations as Interstellar Business Computers and Pottor Light Computers claiming headquarters in the heart of its sprawling cities. Three Castles Brian were erected on the surface, along with twice as many military bases and spaceports, to secure these important assets against any aggressor.&#xD; Unfortunately, the SLDF troops stationed on Nusakan during the Amaris Crisis did not reckon on an attack from within, though they fought hard and long, denying the Usurper's troops an easy victory. Two of the major fortifications, at Holden City and the planetary capital of Jobs City, both on the northern Katamoros continent, were destroyed after weeks of underground fighting that shook the nearby cities and towns. The third, however, at Fort Romas, held out for almost a year, becoming a rally point for the surviving SLDF troops as fighting spread across the planet.&#xD; Though gallant, this resistance ultimately forced Amaris's troops to resort to nuclear assaults to secure Nusakan, destroying not only Fort Romas, but also a large number of the planet's more heavily populated cities and industriplexes. In the Liberation, Nusakan was again pummeled as returning SLDF forces faced a pitched battle in orbit and on the ground. Two WarShips, the SLS Havana and the SLS Dularam, lie in ruins where they crashed on the northern continent, shot down by the planetary defense systems during the fighting.&#xD; By the time of the Star League's collapse, only twenty thousand or so people still lived on this battle-scarred planet, but since that time - and despite the predations of the Succession Wars - people and businesses have gradually returned to Nusakan. Cities have grown near both shipwrecks, named in honor of each one, and the city of Havana, in fact, is the present-day capital of this recovering world.</Description>

Despite a few initial victories, the world's defenders swiftly fell to Star Captain Castris and the troops of Supernova Assault, Nineteenth Striker Cluster. All but a few members of the Nykvarn Armored Battalion survived the fighting.&#xD; The planet's capital city is also called Nykvarn.&#xD; [3059] During Operation Bulldog, the 6th An Ting Legion, Ryuken-Go and the Capellan Red Lancers assaulted Nykvarn. The Jaguar's 124th Garrison Cluster stood little chance against these overwhelming odds, and was completely destroyed.&#xD; [3062] The Fifth Sun Zhang Cadre had the misfortune of rotating onto Nykvarn just in time for the Ghost Bear offensive in 3062. The heavy Sixth Bear Regulars hit the Cadre hard, shattering a full battalion of troops in the first battle alone. Despite creative tactics, which helped draw out the Bears long enough for reinforcements to draw near, the Fifth was forced to fall back to Brocchi�s Cluster for repairs.&#xD; The Ryuken-san took over for the battered Fifth, and kept the Clan bogged down between well-coordinated �Mech and aerospace fighter attacks until the Courchevel Trial.</Description>

Since the late 2900's, Oberon has been heavily industrialized to include factories able to produce pharmaceuticals and electronic components, as well as small arms and energy weapons. Though much of the planet remains unexplored, Oberon's population exceeds 40 thousand inhabitants, many of whom are skilled technicians and scientists.&#xD; [3049] Clan Wolf landed on Oberon VI in September 3049. The Eleventh Wolf Guards faced King Grimm and his First Oberon Guards, who were all willing to die to defend the little empire Grimm had created by piracy and treachery. The fighting, marked by three short, violent clashes, was a quick and total victory for the Wolf Guards.&#xD; Grimm and his heavy 'Mechs found themselves gradually outmaneuvered and outgunned by the OmniMechs of the Eleventh Wolf Guards. When the smoke cleared, the First Oberon Guards were no more. King Grimm died by his own hand rather than submit to capture. Clan Wolf gained valuable insight into the fighting style of the rest of the Inner Sphere, which gave them an early advantage over the other Clans in the invasion.</Description>

As a result, the adaptable species has been introduced to countless worlds throughout known space. Despite the raxx's gentle nature, the animals are fiercely protective of their young and will defend their nesting grounds to the death.&#xD; Three centuries ago, the city of Bealton, built on the banks of the Potomac river, had been the thriving capital of Odessa. Then came the First Succession War, when the Draconis Combine dropped a pair of nuclear bombs on the city, turning it into a wasteland of radioactive and toxic rubble. To make sure the city would never be rebuilt, they also followed up with several chemically based, biotoxic bombs as well - salting the proverbial earth.&#xD; Odessa recovered from the damage of the Succession Wars, and a new capital called New Bealton, was built only a few hours away from the ruins of Bealton. Today, the ruins of old Bealton do not attract many visitors, save for the odd treasure hunter, tempted by rumors of riches still to be found within the remains of the city. &#xD; Odessa has a light industrial base, though the area roundabouts New Bealton has been cultivated for farming, being mostly open terrain; plains and rolling hills and a few forests.&#xD; [3063] Built on a massive hill that dominates New Bealton and the surrounding area, is the political seat of the world - the palace of the Fisk family.

    <Description>One of the League�s youngest provinces, incorporated in 2941 by Samuel Marik, Ohrensen fought bitterly to maintain its independence. The result was a province culturally and politically related to nearby Zion (both regions being �liberated� in the same political gambit that centered on the defection of Vincente Sian-Marik from the Capellan Confederation to the FWL), but which retains control of its own political and economic affairs. As an added benefit, sundering the former Capellan worlds into competing provinces undermined Sian-Marik�s power base,&#xD; Brutalized by Capellan scorched-earth tactics during the secession period, when withdrawing CCAF forces razed almost a third of the towns on the main continent, Rossonia, Ohrensen received massive investment in the mid-30th century, though endemic corruption siphoned off much of the money that flowed into the region. The net result was a world (and province) with a functional industrial and economic infrastructure, but whose population subsisted in conditions well below the League norm. The criminal gangs that sprang up during this era came to dominate planetary politics on Ohrensen and neighboring Ventabren, though today these so-called firms hide their activities behind legitimate businesses.&#xD; Through divided by bitter infighting (which frequently leads to a high body count), these groups acknowledge an overlord, Director Loew, who serves as the de facto planetary and provincial leader. Loew�s enforcers maintain a semblance of order within the �thugocracy� (which the federal government regards as a civilian dictatorship), though recent years have seen growing conflict with Capellan criminal groups seeking to expand their operations into �traditional Capellan territory.� Only in the wilds of the Padderborn Highlands on Rossonia and on the wide-open continents of Ulm and Salva do the criminal gangs have no influence. Here, however, the gangs� violence and intimidation give way to pure lawlessness that leads most farmers and miners to go about armed. The summary justice of these regions is a stark contrast to the peace-by-intimidation of �civilized� Ohrensen.</Description>

    <Description>Okefenokee is one of the poorest worlds in the Federated Suns. Located on the edge of the Periphery, it was inhabited until recently only by religious zealots living in isolated villages in the planet's Great Swamp. Most Humans find the world's many native creatures either dangerous or disgusting.  Beneath the many swamps encircling the tropic and temperate zones, there lies a vast pool of oil. For many years, the oil went undiscovered. When Interstellar Star Petroleum, a large petroleum products company, undertook a vast exploration project under government auspices, they found the oil in this unlikely spot. The discovery has touched off an economic boom on Okefenokee, with money, products, and people pouring onworld. The planet's original settlers and inhabitants resent this sudden influx so much that they have taken to shooting at anyone who enters the swamps. &#xD; [3062] Perhaps the biggest challenge faced by the Anjin Muerto Militia is the conflict on Okefenokee, which has gradually increased to the level of a guerrilla war. Two full regiments of the militia's infantry have been based on the world as peacekeepers for the best part of the last forty years, but they have been caught between the two factions. On top of this, the planet's newfound wealth has made it an inviting target for pirates operating from the Periphery.</Description>

Born from Captain-General Gerald Marik's war against the Selajes that he believed killed his family, this small federation bought its loyalty to the Mariks and hastily installed a pro-Marik government. The Free States soon discovered, however, that freedom on paper was worth little against constant meddling in their politics and economy by their former parent province. Not until Thomas Marik passed the Addendum to the Incorporation in 3037 did the Regulan Free States finally gain the power to chart their own course.&#xD; Since then, local cultures and planetary economies have undergone a vibrant renaissance. No longer strangled by Principality trade embargoes, Free State industry and exports are thriving. The Mongol and Kazhak languages, outlawed in the early days of secessionist rumblings and then rendered virtually irrelevant by Principality dominance of local life, have made a striking comeback to become the primary languages in this tiny province. Norwegian is also widely spoken on Olafsvik, site of a sizeable Norwegian enclave since the earliest days of human settlement.&#xD; [3025] The Maarakiva University on Olafsvik prepares its students for the life of a spaceborne trader, offering more than 300 disciplines to sharpen and master the intricacies of the plain horse trading and dickering.</Description>

All in all, maneuvers here can be as deadly as real jungle warfare, and so the troops that survived here were probably as well qualified to survive similar situations as anyone in the galaxy.&#xD; [3056] Elements of the notorious Rostov Tong have begun a fierce guerrilla war on the planet, severely damaging several of Old Kentucky's cities and generally making life an exercise in anxiety for the average citizen.&#xD; The name Old Kentucky, is of course, the name of an ancient Terran political district.

    <Description>One of the most quickly developed of the early colonies in mankind�s first exodus into space, Oliver�s population grew rapidly as droves of colonists came to exploit its rich, easily tapped resources. Before long, this world became an industrial and military mainstay of the Terran Alliance and its successor, the Terran Hegemony. During the height of the original Star League, in fact, Oliver was home to several major defense contractors, including AeroFighter Unlimited, a major aerospace fighter manufacturer, and BattleMech producer, Brigadier Corporation. &#xD; The fall of the Star League and the Succession Wars that followed, however, were not so kind to Oliver. Both AeroFighter Unlimited and Brigadier�s Warez plant were both destroyed by repeated raids and invasions from the militaries of Houses Steiner, Liao, and even Kurita. The cycle of destruction and reconstruction stagnated the planetary economy. Its pressing need for heightened defense � a result of being a favored target throughout the Wars � led to the inevitable decline of the government into a military dictatorship, and its membership in the Ring Coalition, a loose alliance of other nearby Free Worlds League planets on the Steiner-Liao border. &#xD; Oliver�s capital city, Fort Jagger, is located on the southern continent of Clausia, along with the planet�s primary spaceport. Brigadier Corporation�s main factory, in the city of Gordon, is located on the northeast continent of Gaineshi. Oliver�s third large landmass, Marania, is a less densely populated region, in part because much of it is a frozen tundra, where rampant strip mining from the early days of planetary development have rendered much of the land scarred and unusable.

    <Description>[2828] In the fateful month of June 2828, Chancellor Ilsa Liao decided to lead a strike force of 90 Marauders and 18 Warhammers from the Red Lancers and Prefectorate Guard regiments against Orbisonia (also know as Aosia), then a major Davion staging area. This opening round of the Second Succession War was nearly disastrous. The previous losses of experienced MechWarriors, at the end of the First Succession War on Chesterton, proved to be the decisive factor.&#xD; In a three-day engagement the skillful handling of the lighter armed but more maneuverable Davion �Mechs, in the hands of the Avalon and Ceti Hussars, crushed the Capellan assault and drove the Capellan Household Guards back towards their drop zones. On the forth day of the assault, Ilsa herself was killed in the final rear-guard action that saved the remnant of the Capellan forces. Hereafter, the Red Lancers bore the dual title of the Red Heart Guard in commemoration of their fallen commander.&#xD; [3039] Neither Colonel Archibald McCarron nor his regimental commanders found much comfort in the post-Fourth Succession War era. They welcomed any hope of battle, for they knew that would at least keep the Chancellor and her evil eye from targeting them as she had struck out at so many of her other military leaders. McCarron was surprised when three CCAF senior colonels visited him on Menke in May of 3039, and all but stunned when they suggested he undertake an operation of such magnitude into the Federated Suns. But as he looked over the intelligence reports that they had brought with them, McCarron was quickly won over. &#xD; By no means a full-fledged invasion, it was in fact more than anything designed to be more of a morale-building exercise. The CCAF had just recently driven the Canopians from their nation, but that victory was tempered by the fact that it took five years to do so. The CCAF needed was a true victory, one that was unmistakable and could proclaim to the entire Human Sphere that the Confederation was still a military power, and who better to target than the mighty Federated Suns.&#xD; The sixth world to feel the sting of Archie McCarron was Orbisonia. The First MAC � the Nightriders � pushed hard to make it to Orbisonia as quickly as they could, even enduring a 2-G burn-in to the world. Lacking anything of strategic value, the world has held a dark distinction within the Capellan military since Chancellor Ilsa Liao lost her life there in 2828. Since that time, the CCAF had all but avoided the world, almost in a superstitious fashion. But the Nightriders had no such qualms.&#xD; They attempted the same lightning strike that worked so well on Bethel, but they hadn�t accounted for the AFFS� 4212th Tactical Fighter Wing or the two wings of conventional fighters that the Orbisonia Militia flew. The Nightriders� own fighters were instantly overwhelmed, and the mercenaries had to fight hard just to secure a landing zone on the world. The FedSuns fighters continued to bomb and strafe them for two straight days, preventing the mercenaries from breaking out to even attempt a strike on one of the airbases that their opponents were using. &#xD; By the third day, the Nightriders realized that they would never be able to strike out without the cover of severe weather or an act of God, neither of which were likely. The mercenaries pulled out later that day, apparently the victims of the same bad karma that befell Chancellor Ilsa more than two centuries earlier.</Description>

A department for training MechWarriors also exists, but it often eclipsed by the aerospace programs.&#xD; The most notable instructor is General Tor Miraborg, ex-commander of the Radstadt Province and father of the famed pilot. Miraborg's classes are always full, despite his opposition of many of �verbef�lhavare M�nsdotter's policies.&#xD; The TMM is open to all Republic citizens who can meet its physical and mental entry requirements, but there are always more applicants than available spaces.</Description>

    <Description>Oriente is the most cosmopolitan of the Free Worlds. Early in the Exodus period, House Allison encouraged progressive ideas of science, arts, industry, and commerce. The level of sophistication resulting from having the best-educated populace in the Free Worlds is one thing that the ravages of the Succession Wars have not been able to destroy. Even so, no other world has so deeply felt the effects of the loss of technology and the destruction of industry. Estimates indicate that the standard of living has declined by more than half since the start of the wars. House Halas has considerable military accomplishments, which may be just what Oriente needs, given its vulnerability to Liao attacks. However, the Halases have shown little of the imagination of progressiveness that the Allisons used in making Oriente one of the crown jewels of the Inner Sphere.&#xD; With average temperatures slightly warmer than Terra, Oriente is a lush, green world of rolling grasslands, panoramic mountains, and tropical rainforests. Frequent Liao raids have damaged Oriente's manufacturing facilities, but have left the environment untouched.&#xD; Oriente has been raided so many times in the past that the citizens have become quite blas� about it. Invading MechWarriors find none of the panic they are accustomed to causing, as the populace simply avoids trouble by using well-practiced civil defence procedures.&#xD; Perhaps the most prestigious military academy in the Free Worlds League, the Princefield Military Academy served as the Grand Duchy of Oriente's principal military school for more than 750 years. Many of the League's most famous commanders began their careers at the academy, including Captain-Generals Janos and Anton Marik, and to this day many consider Princefield to be a finishing school for young nobles.&#xD; Entry to Princefield is theoretically open to all citizens of the League, but only those with the right political connections or funding are likely to gain admittance. Political orthodoxy takes second place to bloodlines and connections, and several times in the past Princefield has been at the core of troubles within the League. The LCCC ensures that a certain number of common-born but able candidates gain entry to the academy each year, but such students are often abused by their noble-born fellow students.</Description>

    <Description>[3066] Oscar was originally settled during the Taurian Concordat's expansion programs of the 3020's and 30's. Led by Baron Kithrong, the people of Oscar and five of the Concordat's spinward-most colonies, banded together and announced their secession from the Taurian Concordat as a whole until Erik Martens-Calderon is named Protector; Kithrong has publicly sworn that he will see Erik on the Taurian throne or die trying. Formerly recognized on the 19th December 3066, the so-called Calderon Protectorate's capital is based on Erod's Escape.</Description>

    <Description>Because Oshikais the capital of a prefecture, it has many cities devoted to the politics of running the prefecture.  The captial of the planet, Takadanobaba, is situated in the world's only major mountain range, the Tribly Range.  The planet is also the regimental headquarters to the 16th Galedon Regulars, which means that General Francisco Bevier is the real source of political power on the planet.  Poor in resources, Oshika can grow enough crops to sustain its population only with the aid of imported chemical fertilizers.   The indegenous Oshika Ox, which looks like a cross between an elephant and a cow, is becoming a profitable food item for the planet, and many farms are converting to ranches to raise the animals.  It is uncertain, however, whether the profits brought in by the animals will offset the cost of importing food.</Description>

    <Description>In 2818 the newly formed 54th Lyran Guard were sent on its first, and only mission. Trained under Colonel Hempsted, the commanding officer of the legendary Stealths, the 54th were sent unassisted to capture the Draconis Combine world of Otho. Colonel Hempsted and his aides vigorously objected to this shocking bit of news, stating that there was no way to predict how a regiment of even the best trained combat-virgins, would perform in actual battle conditions. The Lyran high command did comprise slightly, by allowing several members of the Stealths to accompany the 54th as aides. They would not allow Colonel Hempsted to go, though he demanded the right.&#xD; The young MechWarriors soon cracked beneath the pressure put on them by a veteran Kurita 'Mech unit, and the entire 54th were destroyed. Hearing of the disaster, Archon Richard Steiner reshuffled the high command, and court-martialed those directly responsible for sending the 54th to Otho. A very melancholy Colonel Hempsted was then promoted to Hauptman-General, with dual command of the Kurita front and over the training of all recruits and cadets.</Description>

Beset by the Izanagi Warriors and Eighth Sword of Light, supported by the Com Guard Thirty-Ninth Division, the Clan forces were crushed in just five days.&#xD; The remnants of the two Clan forces were eventually surrounded in the Marin Valley. Tai-sa Shin Yodama led his company of Izanagi Warriors down into the hollow, understanding that he must destroy any remaining Jaguars were overwhelming force. As a gesture of respect he gave the Clan warriors, led by Galaxy Commander Mikhail Ward, a chance to die as warriors, by permitting single combat. Yodama's unit enjoyed a slight advantage in strength, but the Jaguars' ferocity negated this edge. &#xD; In the first round of fighting, eight Kurita 'Mechs and four Jaguar 'Mechs won their engagements, with Galaxy Commander Ward falling to Tai-sa Yodama. Then the remaining forces matched up, after which only one Jaguar 'Mech remained standing. Shin Yodama defeated this warrior in less than thirty seconds, claiming an astounding victory.</Description>

    <Description>Outreach, the so-called Mercenary's World, was first settled during the 22nd century by Terran colonists attracted by the planet's warm climate, large tracts of arable land, and abundant natural resources. During these early years, Outreach became known as an agricultural exporter, but tourism became the mainstay of the planet's economy after the planet began to host the Star League Martial Olympiads in 2704. Following the collapse of the Star League toward the end of the century, however, Outreach's tourism industry quickly died, forcing many inhabitants to emigrate.&#xD; In 2786 Outreach came under Capellan Control, and its fortunes continued to decline for almost 200 years. During the Forth Succession War, the Federated Commonwealth captured the planet. Following the cessation of hostilities, Prince Hanse Davion granted Outreach to Wolf's Dragoons, the most famous and formidable mercenary unit in the Inner Sphere. That action heralded a renaissance for the world. Determined to create a home for themselves, the Dragoons immediately began to rebuild Harlech, the decaying capital of Outreach. Within a few years, the Dragoons had transformed Outreach into the center of the mercenary trade for the Inner Sphere.&#xD; Today, Outreach remains one of the few worlds of the Chaos March untouched by the bloody conflict raging in the region. Unwilling to pay the high cost of battling the Dragoons' five regiments for control of the planet, Chancellor Sun-Tzu Liao proclaimed Outreach as an independent barony of the Capellan Confederation. Generally, business has gone on as usual on Outreach. The renowned Hiring Hall, which is operated under the supervision of the Mercenary Review and Bonding Commission, continues to attract mercenaries and employers. In fact, the instability in the surrounding systems has caused a surge of activity at the hall, as employers from the embattled worlds of the Chaos March come to the city in search of mercenaries. Just as the mercenary trade has benefited from the tensions in the March, so have Outreach's 'Mech and weapon dealers, as well as numerous other industries that support the mercenary trade. However, the troubles in the March have dampened Outreach's tourist industry somewhat.&#xD; In addition to Outreach's healthy economy, the competent Dragoon government and the planet's state-of-the-arty defenses have helped make Outreach an oasis of calm in the March. Dragoon commander Jamie Wolf rules the planet with a firm yet fair hand, and the Cyclops I Orbital station enables the Dragoons to closely monitor all incoming DropShips. These two conditions virtually ensure that none of the surrounding unrest will spill onto Outreach.&#xD; Outreach contains twin continents, named Romulus and Remus. Romulus contains the planet's capital, Harlech, as well as all its major cities and commercial enterprises. A mountain range known as the Ridge bisects Romulus, and outside of the cities, the continent's countryside turns in small farms and lightly forested hills. Remus, also known as the Outback, is the private hold of Wolf's Dragoons. The mercenary unit maintains a headquarters and training facilities on this arid desert continent. The entire planet enjoys a warm, temperate climate all year round.</Description>

    <Description>One of the worlds most damaged in the Succession Wars, Ozawa is a mere shell of the world that once stood proud of its history, culture, industry, and science. Everything that had been desirable about living on Ozawa made it a target for nuclear weapons from both the Draconis Combine and the Capellan Confederation.&#xD; It was settled in the first wave from Terra, mostly by Japanese colonists. Though they had some trouble adjusting to the planet's extreme weather and extraordinary tides, they discovered important mineral deposits that made it worth their while to battle the harsh conditions. The planet soon became the center for technology relating not only to terraforming, but also protecting the planet's natural beauty. The colonists, who by this time had become numerous, were careful to preserve the clean environment.&#xD; The world became an industrial, scientific, and economic gem. First came the electronics industry. This technology base drew other companies' attention. The giant Ulsop robotics conglomerate located an experimental facility on Ozawa. It was there that the scientists did much of the research and development that led to the Space Defense Systems. Ozawa also was the headquarters for Diplan 'Mechyards, a major producer of BattleMechs.&#xD; After the industry and science came the financial institutions. The Star League built the city of Prosperity, a financial hub that featured a regional stock exchange and the mint for the currency used in the Federated Suns.&#xD; The fall of the Star League ended Ozawa's Golden Age. Because of its importance, this world was seized by the Federated Suns but was attacked repeatedly during the First Succession War by Houses Kurita and Liao. These were compounded by a wave of anti-Asian paranoia that spread through Ozawa's non-Japanese population. Violence now characterized a place whose name had become synonymous with a reverence for life. The end came when the Kuritans did not hesitate to make extensive use of nuclear devices during a major push to capture the planet. The city of Prosperity was obliterated. Now the landscape of Ozawa is like that of a tortured, twisted corpse. The few inhabitants stay well clear of the Hot Zones, where radiation levels are still lethal.&#xD; Despite the devastation, Ozawa is important today. Though its beauty is gone and its reduced population now lives in domed cities, the planet is the capital of its administrative area in the Federated Suns bureaucracy. It is also the headquarters of the Intelligence-Gathering Services division of the Ministry of Intelligence, Investigations, and Operations.</Description>

    <Description>[3062] Until the Clan invasion, the Qanatir MTM was a backwater assignment, occasionally facing pirates but otherwise seeing little action. Since 3050, however, pirate activity in the region has increased markedly, reflecting both the weakening of Periphery defenses following the Clan invasion and a similar shift in pirate bands away from the invasion corridor. The greatest problem for the militia is the band known as Morrison's Extractors, who operate from a pair of worlds about 30 light-years outside of the Alliance. &#xD; The near-destruction of the Neerabup Militia in the Jade Falcon invasion forced the Qanatir militia to extend its operational area, and elements of the militia are scattered on a swath of worlds between Main Street and Krung Theo. These subunits work closely with Com Guard troops assigned in the region, principally from the Engadine-based 214th Division.</Description>

    <Description>Quandahar is a dark world with almost perpetual cloud cover.  Though the planet has large bodies of water, the industries of the planet's early colonizers dumped toxic waste into every water source.  Now, the planet's sizeable population must import its fresh water.  Industry still flourishes on this planet, selling and manufacturing sub-assemblies for small fusion power plants used to power cities.  Qandahar's sizeable Arab population has a history of rebellion against the rule of the Planetary Chairman.  Currently, the dissident underground, calling itself the Holy Struggle, is attempting to shut down the Dow-Nexus Turbine Factory because it has consistently disregarded workers' safety.  Although the ISF has several agents in the Holy Struggle, Subhash Indrahar is hesitant to break up the group because he is not overly fond of Dow-Nexus.  Outside the planetary capital, Fair Weather, and the other domed cities, the planet's ecosystem is on its last legs.  Over 50 percent of the indigenous life forms have become extinct.  Only the Toxic Life Forms (TLF), created on Terra during the 22nd century to digest toxic wastes, are thriving. &#xD; [3054] The Dow-Nexus company is in trouble. When the Clans moved into Kuritan space, they captured factories accounting for 70 percent of DN's market. Manufacturers of conventional vehicles have expressed an interest in DN's product line, but generally are unwilling to pay the higher fusion engine prices, which seem excessive compared to the prices of I.C.E.s they currently use.</Description>

    <Description>First settled in the early days of the Third Succession War, the original mining colony of Quantraine was wiped out in a deep-space raid by ex-Kurita mercenaries in 3014. Settled again in 3016 by religious fundamentalists, the planet has since become the cultural home of the Islamic religion in Alliance Space. Supporting itself through the successful mining and exportation of rare and precious gemstones, the second Quantraine colony has managed not only to survive its initial years of hardship but to prosper. It would most certainly have become a major cultural center except for the outbreak of a rare contagious blood disease accidentally brought in by offworld traders. The plague carried off more than 60% of the population in 3020. The few who have remained have since banned all contact with non-Alliance commerce while inaugurating an Alliance-wide appeal to all Islamic peoples to come to the aid of their brethren. In the last five years, the population of Quantraine has recovered marginally, growing from a bare 400 survivors to over 4500. The current inhabitants remain among the most xenophobic of any of the Alliance's many diverse peoples.</Description>

    <Description>[3051] The Quarell 'Mech Battalion tried to use the hit-and-run tactics that other units had used successfully against the Clans, but failed. Using fighter surveillance and orbital 'Mechs drops, the Gyrfalcon Galaxy warriors ran down the Quarell 'Mechs and, enraged over their recent losses to Clan Steel Viper, exceeded even their usual ruthlessness. Only six members of the Quarell 'Mech Battalion survived to become bondsmen.&#xD; [3053] After the near destruction of the Blue Star Irregulars' 21st Rim Worlds regiment at the hands of Clan Jade Falcon, the Irregulars' two other constituent regiments, the 1894th Light Horse, and the Avatars of Painful Death, immediately petitioned Morgan Hasek-Davion for permission to assault Quarell, the Falcon's home base.&#xD; At his reluctant approval, the regiments jumped into the Quarell system and, to their detriment, ignored the Falcon's requests for batchall. Consequently, three Clusters of Falcon OmniMechs prepared to meet the mercenaries' ground assault, while a single Falcon Fredasa-class corvette and Falcon OmniFighters launched an attack against the Blue Star JumpShips. This time, the Falcon aerospace attack was met by the mercenary fighter regiment Hell's Black Aces, who had been subcontracted by the Irregulars. Emerging from hidden positions behind the JumpShips sails, they quickly claimed space superiority over Quarell.&#xD; The Clan WarShip seemed undeterred, however, and when it attempted to close with a severely damaged Blue Star JumpShip, the JumpShip captain was forced to ram the Falcon vessel with his own. This near suicidal tactic worked, however, destroying the WarShips primary command center. The Black Aces claimed it and an escorting Falcon DropShip in the name of the Blue Star Irregulars.&#xD; The mercenaries fared less well on the ground, unable to overcome the Falcons� technological and numerical advantages. The 1894th Light Horse managed to hold its own and destroy several Jade Falcon supply dumps, but the Avatars became trapped between two Falcon Clusters. Before the Light Horse could act, the Falcons collapsed their trap around the Avatars, and destroyed the regiment.&#xD; Realizing the battle was lost, Colonel Alexander Duff-Gordon led his Light Horse against a large Falcon supply cache and captured it. He then issued a challenge to the Falcon commander, Star Colonel Padrick Shi-lu, offering the supply cache and captured Falcon WarShip against the lives of any captured Avatar or Rim World warriors, all captured Blue Star medals, and safe conduct back to FedCom space. Within minutes, Duff-Gordon and seven Blue Star MechWarriors were facing Star Colonel Padrick and four Falcon warriors on the Plains of Richlu. Duff-Gordon managed to kill Star Colonel Padrick moments before his Warhammers fusion engine overheated and exploded. &#xD; In the end, only two of the Irregulars remained alive, but they had won the challenge. The Irregulars returned to Rasalgethi, where they mourned their loses and began to rebuild for the day they would face the Clans again. The Fredasa-class WarShip, renamed Kerensky's Blues, was repaired and partially refitted with the help of Wolf's Dragoons, whilst the Titan-class DropShip was gratefully ceded to Hell's Black Aces as their part of the salvage.</Description>

    <HasFactory>true</HasFactory>
    <Description>A world of abundant raw materials, from basic industrial metals to rarer radioactive elements and even naturally-formed crystalline minerals useful in various optical products, the first settlers to Quentin were actually employees of Terran corporations hoping to exploit such valuable resources for their ambitious ventures. During the Age of War, many of these industries turned to military applications, and the planet's economy truly thrived, but with such prosperity came the desire by various neighboring governments to secure Quentin and its industries for themselves. Only the rise of the Star League saved Quentin from the worst ravages of war. &#xD; The League's dominion, which included Quentin, brought even more wealth to the world when they established a major BattleMech manufacturing plant in the densely industrialized Steel Valley region. This factory ultimately became the centerpiece for Independence Weaponry in the centuries after the League's collapse, and, in its heyday, produced scores of heavy and assault BattleMech designs - including the JagerMech, Victor, and Atlas. Immediately after the collapse of the League, however, forces from the Draconis Combine, Capellan Confederation, and the Federated Suns fought bitterly for control of this important world.&#xD; The planet still retains the scars of that fighting in the form of its caustic atmosphere - the result of a massive biological-weapon attack, launched against the world by retreating would-be conquerors in the First Succession War. The majority of the planet's population today resides in and around Steel Valley, on the equatorial continent of Morandi, which is also home to the planetary capital of Prosperity Point. The other planetary continents, El Largo in the northern hemisphere, Gladius in the south, and El Minoro in the southern polar region, are far less populous, due to the extreme cold temperatures in those regions, and the gradual decline of these outlying areas during the last few centuries of war.</Description>

    <Description>Raballa houses a major underground AeroSpace support installation.  If this facility is as new as Our Blessed Order suspects, it should prove a major shot in the arm for what has long been a badly faltering planetary economy.  As changing weather conditions have caused Raballa's farm production to decline drastically, this former food-exporting world must now import most of its food, ruining its balance of trade.  The reason that the Liao military has established the support installation on Raballa is that the natives are fiercely loyal to the Capellan government.</Description>

Tired of the chase, the Bears showed the planet's defenders little mercy when they finally caught up with them.&#xD; Alpha Nova Star, of the 115th Striker Cluster, saturated the field with weapons fire and refused all offers of surrender until they had destroyed all four lances of Rasalhagian 'Mechs. Only then did the Bear's accept the surrender of the rest of the Free Company.

The Lotus Flower Correctional Institution is a sprawling facility the size of a small city and is located just outside Munich, the planetary capital.  The most dangerous criminals, those insane enough to openly rebel against the Kurita government, are held in the Black Tower, a huge windowless, concrete building.  Surrounding the building is a ring of fences and minefields to deter anyone leaving.  The rest of the planet is nondescript.  There is a thriving fishing industry, and the timber industry specializes in Radstadt Pine, a tree whose wood (if treated) literally shimmers as if it were flecked with gold.</Description>

    <Description>Rahne is a small world lacking adequate water and growing seasons.  Because the planet's surface is wracked by major dust storms, the need to protect exposed machinery has greatly hampered aboveground exploitation of Rahne's gems and radioactive deposits.  Geologists report that Rahne originated from a planet twice its size that collided with a huge asteroid.  As a result of the collision, the original planet split into Rahne and its moon, Caliban.&#xD; The gravitational effect of massive Caliban upon the planet's atmosphere and its one sea give Rahne its severe weather conditions.  The planet has four seasons: Storm, Calm, Cold, Melting.  Of the four, Melting is the most dangerous, as temperatures rise above 100 degrees C.  Fortunately, each season lasts only 21 days.&#xD; How native life evolved on such a world is a mystery.  The Rahne Toad-Fox, a squat beast with red fur and an evil disposition, is an example of what it takes to survive on this planet.  During the Storm and Calm seasons, the Toad-Fox is a nocturnal hunter.  Using its foot-long ears and ten-inch claws that drip with poison, it seeks out and kills prey, usually Slimy Rock-Huggers.  During the Cold, the Toad-Fox looks for a mate by drumming out an invitation upon its chest.  Once mated, the Toad-Foxes bury themselves by literally ripping through a mountainside, where they give birth and live during the Melting.&#xD; For humans, only the Calm and Cold seasons are hospitable enough to allow anyone to venture outside the subterranean cities.&#xD; [3025] Zettle Metals Incorporated, who specialize in the purification of rare metals, especially those used to construct BattleMech chassis, have two foundries on Rahne.</Description>

    <Description>Situated several light years beyond the junction of Davion and Kurita space, the warm, semi-tropical world of Ramora is the center of the largest weapons-producing facility in Outworlds space outside the capital. Ramora also hosts one of the newest joint Draconian-Outworlds aerospace fighter production centers, which is located along the equatorial rim of the planet and operates through one of United Outworlds Corporation's major arms production factories. The joint center is capable of producing an estimated 100 Lightning aerospace fighters annually, as well as the engineering of spare parts and machinery vital to any long-term Alliance defense plan.&#xD; Ramora is also noteworthy from a cultural standpoint, for it is the nexus of the Taoist religion in Alliance space. Given its military and cultural importance, as well as its relative proximity to potential enemy attacks from "over the border", Ramora maintains a permanent garrison of a battalion of Alliance Borderers, based at Danforth. At present an estimated 13000 technicians and specialists work on this key world.</Description>

    <Description>No one can determine exactly when Randis was colonized, though it somehow became a destination for people looking to escape the ravages of the Succession Wars. Without the resources of a Great House or a large corporation to underwrite their colonization efforts, the world's first inhabitants had to overcome both the vastness of space and their new home's native environment in order to build their new civilization. Many did not survive. Those that did, however, found at least a shadow of what they were looking for: a world far away from the war and intrigue plaguing the Inner Sphere. Though not immune to the problems of humanity, the people of the world, known as Hope survived.&#xD; As the Succession Wars dragged on, more and more of the dregs of humanity found their way into the Periphery. It was during these "formative" years that the world slowly transformed into a crossroads of sorts, with pirates and other traders from across the Periphery using the system to trade and exchange their goods. The world's name changed to reflect its changed position, and it quickly became known as Lost Hope.&#xD; It wasn't until the middle of the Third Succession War that matters began to change. Erdelmaine Randis left the Free World's League military in disgust, traveling for years throughout the Inner Sphere on a quest worthy of Diogenes. With no simple answers at hand, he eventually found himself on Lost Hope amid a group of broken and dispirited MechWarriors who were also looking for answers. Together, they found a new beginning.&#xD; In 2998, Randis announced the formation of the Brotherhood of Randis. The people of the world rallied behind his cause and renamed the planet in honor of the man who brought about this change. Since then, life on Randis has changed significantly for the better. The reforms of Erdelmaine Randis brought new hope, not only to his own people, but to people scattered throughout the Periphery. As word of his work spread, a new generation of "seekers" found their way to Randis, hoping against hope that the rumors were true. The world's population grew slowly, and the influx of new dreams brought a renewed sense of pride in Randis' people and the quality of living grew.&#xD; Today, Randis' inhabitants have finally linked their cities by modern rail. The world's largest cities have now turned into true commerce centers, each with its own spaceport. Though the standard of living still hovers below that of the average "civilized" world, life on Randis is the best it has ever been, certainly better than most Periphery worlds can boast.&#xD; [3037] In 3037 Randis took it's next and greatest leap, with the ascension of Brother Galahad Frews to Grand Knight. He redirected the Brotherhood's energies toward developing better warriors, not just brutally hazing its adepts to see who could survive the initiation. Frews slowly built up the Brotherhood, turning them into the fighting force they were destined to be. Soon afterward, Randis became not only a lone haven for the free, but one rid of the daily threat of violence from outlaw bands.&#xD; [3051] The true test of the new Brotherhood came in 3051, when Grand Knight Frews lead them to Antallos. There the Brotherhood held off the much stronger Fuchida's Fusiliers while plundering a long-forgotten Star League cache for themselves.&#xD; Over the course of the last decade, the Brotherhood has made a name for themselves, proving truly to be a beacon of sorts deep in the Periphery. Word of the Brotherhood has even reached the Clans, prompting two expatriate Clan warriors to make the trek to Randis. Lucas Beckett made his way to Randis in late 3060 and quickly proved not only his proficiency, but also his dedication to the Brotherhood's ethos. Once a Smoke Jaguar Star Commander but born into Clan Cloud Cobra's Josian Cloister, Beckett espoused many of the same ideals as the Brotherhood and had little difficulty adapting to their ways. Within just two years' time, Beckett had not only infused the Brotherhood with a number of Clan ideals, but had also succeeded Galahad Frews as Grand Knight.</Description>

Rasal is covered with huge hardwood forests, taller than most BattleMechs, growing ten centimeters a year and reaching heights of nearly 100 meters tall.&#xD; The other continent, Karlstad, is located to the east and is covered in mountains and glaciers. Located mostly in the northern hemisphere, Karlstad stretches into the polar region. Karlstad�s mountains are laced with numerous veins of rare metals and precious stones that have become one of the main exports of the planet.

    <Description>Rasalhague has an ancient history going back into pre-Hegemony days, when a large group of Swedish and Northern Europeans left a war-torn Terra.  They found a large world orbiting far from its huge sun and possessing abundant water and natural resources.  Rasalhague was so similar to their former countries that the colonists ignored its few bad qualities, such as a deadly local virus.&#xD;  Since that time, large industries have sprung up to take advantage of the plentiful natural resources, including the various exotic fruits and animals from the jungles of the planet's torrid tropical zone.&#xD;  The wishes of the people to stay free and independent were dashed when the Principality of Rasalhague fell to the Draconis Combine.  Although sometimes brutal, the Draconis Combine has respected the independence of Rasalhague and has not destroyed the large and solemn Palace Hall, the government building located in Reykjavik, the capital city of Rasalhague.&#xD; The capital city of Rasalhague is Reykjavik. It has three major continents. The northern continent contains the capital. The central tropical continent is named Ystad, and the southern frigid, polar continent is named Hammerfest which contains vital industrial centers.  &#xD; Every July, a new strain of the Fenris flu emerges from the Rasalhague tropics. This flu, a constantly mutating strain of the deadly Fenris plague, is always debilitating, though usually not fatal.</Description>

The company owns some five trillion acres spread over five worlds, and these produce high-yield, quick-growing grains, most of which are harvested and shipped to various offworld customers. &#xD; The largest customer for Rastaban's grains is the Draconis Combine. Because House Kurita often fails to produce enough food for its many worlds due to inept management and harsh labor policies, its agents but huge amounts of Commonwealth grain through third parties. The Commonwealth government supports this business effort, and actively encourages Rastaban to seek even more business across the border.&#xD; [3052] The MechWarriors of the Second Regiment of the Knights of St. Cameron found themselves torn between loyalties by the arrival of the Clans, just as did their sister regiment. Unfortunately, the whereabouts of each warrior in the Second Regiment can be accounted for. The Knights of St. Cameron showed great spirit, if not skill, in their attempts to blunt the advance of Clan Wolf�s Third Battle Cluster toward the capital of Rastaban, Castle City, in January 3052.  &#xD; At Hill 3032, a battalion of the Knights held the crest of a ridge for just an instant too long and where surrounded. They refused to surrender and died fighting to the last MechWarrior. Most of the remaining Knights died at Sanguine Valley during a particularly brutal push by the OmniMechs and Elementals of the Third Battle Cluster.</Description>

    <Description>Among the most crucial variables that a strategist must consider when planning to invade a hostile planet is how long it will take DropShips and fighters to reach the target world. The longer it takes, the longer the planetary defenders have to prepare their own reception for the approaching enemy. An ideal world for attack is one whose sun is so small that invading forces could conceivably reach the planet before the planet's defenders realize the enemy had arrived in the system.  Redfield is such a planet. Its small sun makes it possible for DropShips and fighters to make the trip at maximum velocity in a matter of hours. Its terrain, with so many open areas, is also prime for invasion. This explains why Redfield has been the site of so many Capellan invasions, even though star systems like Shoreham or Royalston are closer to them. The suns in those systems are much larger than Redfield's, making their planets far easier to defend.  All the emphasis placed on Redfield's strategic importance is unfortunate because the planet itself has several unique features that the Federated Suns could put to good use if it were not so busy trying to defend it. There are, for example, several large, fertile plains that could easily produce extensive food crops. There are also several indigenous life forms that might be important food items for export to other worlds with dim suns. All that means little to the many thousand soldiers on the planet. The Federated Suns is far too concerned with defending Redfield to allow the planet's population to do more than try to grow enough food to keep themselves alive.</Description>

The Hindu influence that marked its early history, when the Selaj family ruled like maharajas, has been gradually dissipating since the 2550's, when the Selaj fled the League. &#xD; Recently, political developments on Regulus have been extremely duplicitous. For centuries, Regulan representatives have been a leading voice of the loyal opposition in the Free Worlds Parliament. The possibility of secession from the Free Worlds has arisen, but Derick Cameron-Jones fears Capellan intervention more than he resents Marik mercantile guidelines. The mercurial Dame Humphreys, Duchess of Andurien, has sounded out Cameron-Jones on the subjects of secession, bloodless coups, and formation of a sixth Successor House, but how far these ideas have gone is open to conjecture. ComStar believes that Cameron-Jones is using the Duchess as a stalking horse for his own political purposes, which are more economic than political. Tradition notwithstanding, there is no way of guessing whose side he might join if it comes to a showdown between the Marik and the Duchess.&#xD; Regulus is also the homeworld of the Free Worlds' most popular entertainer, John "Icepick" Melton, a man of many talents who never performs the same act twice. Actor, comedian, musician, performance artist, and magician, he presents the illusion of singing underwater, makes large musical instruments appear and disappear by slight of hand, and levitates his audience while holotaping live comedies. He takes pride in never having let one minute of redeeming social value into any of his performances, and fans from Delcour to Claybrooke attest that his show is the most fun they ever had in a theater.</Description>

With the military campaign over, Major Sandra Aupriz set about winning the peace via a hearts-and-minds campaign designed to demonstrate all the freedoms the former Capellan citizens would gain under the open and enlightened rule of the Magistracy. Many reveled in the social and political freedoms this presented, but the direct and uninhibited nature of the Canopians did not rest well with many middle- and upper-class citizens, many of whom came to regard their �liberation� as a descent into a morass of licentiousness.&#xD; [3034] After victories on Jacomarie and Repulse respectively, Ishara�s Grenadiers and Kincade�s Rangers sought to continue their winning streak in the Capellan counter-attack. Renown, held by Drummond�s Destroyers (who had just escaped the Rangers and House Dai Da Chi on Repulse) and the diminutive Jenkin�s Armored Cavalry, held little value for the Canopians and, fearing another Dai Da Chi assault, the MAF force withdrew before a shot was fired.</Description>

    <Description>On 19 September the first MAF forces crossed the frontier and struck at Capellan targets on the Periphery border. This Taskforce Duo comprised the Second Canopian Light Horse, Second Canopian Cuirassiers, and the Second Canopian&#xD;Fusiliers, and it struck at Kincade�s Rangers on Repulse. Formerly part of the Tikonov Reserves, the Rangers had been reallocated to the newly formed Periphery Guard on the orders of Romano Liao. Magistracy intelligence had reported both battalions of the Capellan force had been badly depleted during the Fourth Succession War and would pose little resistance to the invasion force. What they neglected to learn, however, was that the �troop depletions� were scheduled rotations to serve with the Death Commandos. Though outnumbered, the Rangers would punch well above their weight.&#xD; The Light Horse quickly learned this lesson after their landings on 1 October, when Major Sharon Lasonpiri�s force quickly came under attack from a Kincade detachment who�d been close enough to react to the landings and hit the Canopians while they were still scattered and disorganized. In the chaos, the Light Horse lost several lances of �Mechs, possibly even a full company, while the Rangers suffered damage to roughly a company of �Mechs, all of which were easily repairable. Though that Ranger detachment was forced to surrender, it was not an auspicious start to the Canopian campaign.&#xD; The heavier Fusiliers faired somewhat better against the Rangers, their added resilience and firepower allowing them to weather the hit-and-run strikes that the Rangers came to favor over the next few months. Grossly outnumbered, the Rangers refused Canopian attempts to draw them into a field engagement, on one day striking at a Canopian detachment in the south and the next at one several hundred miles north or west. By the end of October the Canopians controlled the major population centers but could hardly be said to control the planet.&#xD; Civil unrest on Repulse increased drastically in the early months of 3031, with bombings and attacks reaching a crescendo around the Chinese New Year. Kincade�s Rangers escalated their attacks, striking targets deep in occupied territory. The Light Horse moved swiftly to oppose these incursions, but in most cases arrived too late. On the rare occasion they were able to bring the Rangers to battle, the Liao troops demonstrated their skill and finesse, inflicting painful damage before escaping.&#xD; The attacks slackened off as Repulse�s northern hemisphere, the site of most of the fighting, entered its long harsh winter, though the Canopians clearly understood that this was a lull in the fighting rather than a victory. They were thus surprised when a group of previously hidden Liao DropShips boosted for orbit on 9 May, rendezvousing with a CCAF JumpShip at a pirate point and departing the system. The Canopians suspected a trap and spent the next three months scouring the planet for the Rangers, but to no avail. Sporadic civil resistance continued for much of the year, but it appeared that Kincade�s Rangers had abandoned Repulse, and on 6 August the world was incorporated into the Magistracy.&#xD; [3033] Fresh from their victory on Drozan, Kincade�s Rangers assaulted Repulse in May 3033. Drummond�s Destroyers, the MAF garrison on Repulse, were hit hard. After initial shock and losses, the Canopian resolve quickly hardened, and it seemed likely a new stalemate would result. News of Liao reinforcements worried the Canopians, but even when the skull insignia of the Death Commandos was reported among the Capellan forces the MAF troops� resolve held, albeit barely. &#xD;The news on 10 June of House Dai Da Chi�s arrival was more than the defenders could stand, however, and immediate plans were put in place for an evacuation. By the end of the month, the Capellan Dao flew once more over Repulse.</Description>

    <Description>In 2826, the Minnesota Tribe made one last attack against an inhabited Kurita world, hitting the world of Richmond with a vengeance.&#xD; Though it was inconceivable that the Tribe could have known about the large prison and slave camps on the planet, their 'Mechs went straight for them. After easily overpowering the guards, they were soon freeing the many thousands of prisoners. Several DropShips then landed in the midst of the prison complexes to load up and transport all the freed prisoners offworld before the Kurita 'Mechs could arrive on the scene. &#xD; Though no one realized it for quite awhile, the liberation of the prisoners and Unproductives on Richmond was the last time the Minnesota Tribe was seen in the Inner Sphere.&#xD; [3050] Tai-sa Donald Ashira, commander of the First Alshain Regulars, responded with what the Clans considered honor to Khan Osis's batchall in March 3050. To oppose the Regulars, Khan Osis deployed two Trinaries; Ashira chose the rocky ground of the Crag gorge as the battlefield. The Kurita troops fought hard, but the Smoke Jaguar forces used their superior weapons and 'Mechs to whittle down the Regulars' greater numbers over the course of four days.&#xD; Knowing they faced desperate odds, the Kurita troops swore an oath not to surrender, then made their last stand in Olderson Pass in the north wall of the gorge. The Smoke Jaguars, using the frontal assault tactics for which they later became infamous, smashed through Richmond's defenders and obliterated the Regulars. Fewer than 5% of the DCMS troops survived to become bondsmen of Clan Smoke Jaguar.&#xD; [3059] During Operation Bulldog, the entire Smoke Jaguar 47th Garrison Cluster on Richmond abandoned the world, after receiving the recall order on the 13th August 3059.&#xD; [3062] The Second An Ting Legion faced the Fifth Bear Regulars on Richmond during the Dominion�s invasion, but a daring strike by the second sword of Light on Constance forced the attacking Bears to fall back and secure their base world, giving the Second An Ting a brief reprieve from the heavy fighting.</Description>

Neither the loss of the Oliver plant nor the company's notorious inefficiency in vehicle design, however, have reduced orders from the LAAF, who cannot be too choosy in the post-Civil War era. &#xD; Still, the relocation of the Pandora plant to a safer interior world � mostly at the expense of Lyran taxpayers � has given company executives a long-overdue opportunity to improve upon some of the company�s more wasteful practices, allowing them to streamline production and cut costs overall.</Description>

One of the first worlds to be settled, both planet and moon were bustling centers of industry and commerce during the days of the Star League. &#xD; Located near the heart of the Terran Hegemony, both the planet and moon were heavily fortified by the SLDF, with Castles Brian and surface-to-orbit defense stations on each. During the crisis that brought down the Star League, however, Amaris troops captured the Riken complexes in a well-coordinated blitzkrieg and used the orbital weapons to bombard the planet below, where remnants of the SLDF unit posted on the moon had gone to regroup. At such ranges, however, the aim was inaccurate, and missed shots from both the planetary and lunar bases delivered massive damage to the surface of both worlds. &#xD; In the years after the League's fall, under the banner of the Lyran state, Rigil Kentarus and its moon began to recover from the devastation, despite numerous attacks launched by the Free Worlds League and the Draconis Combine.&#xD; The twin capitals of West Romaine on the planet's large southern continent of Naskia, and Destina Station on Riken Minor's Lesser Plateau continent, maintain the bulk of each world's commercial and administrative infrastructure. The large spaceport city of Mesopita, located on Worrens, Rigil Kentarus' northern continent, is the planet's principal link to the moon and the stars beyond, and so is also home to a sizeable portion of the planetary militia.</Description>

    <Description>Famous for deep valleys that twist across its surface, settlers named Rio after a similar canyon in Terra's western hemisphere. Rio lacks significant exports and relied instead on its dramatic natural beauty to attract tourists, Tri-Vid production houses, and art colonies to boost its early economy. Rio lost its independence to the Tikonov Union in 2223. When the Capellan Confederation absorbed the Tikonov Union 150 years later, Rio's planetary council petitioned for incorporation in the Terran Hegemony. &#xD; Rio went on to prosper as a center of fine arts, filmmaking, and high-end tourism throughout the First Star League. Both House Liao and House Kurita claimed Rio after the fall of the First Star League. In 2806, the Confederation unleashed nuclear weapons against the Combine to break the stalemate. Radioactive craters obliterated Rio's landscape and forced most of its population off-planet. In the end, neither side occupied the ruined world. Realizing Rio's strategic position in the Terran corridor, House Davion claimed the planet and used Rio as a base to support military action against House Liao for most of the Succession Wars. &#xD; In 2980, the Confederation tried to retake Rio with an enormous aerospace assault that ended in spectacular defeat, leading to a major restructuring of Capellan aerospace forces. Conditions on Rio have not changed since the early Succession Wars. The Republic of the Sphere established self-sufficient cantonments to stabilize Rio's economy. Rio only sports two continents, both which sit astride the equator: Grando and Pequeno. The capital, Reno, is on Grando.</Description>

    <Description>Colonized in the late 24th century, Roadside was selected to supply the needs of a growing population in the Lyran Commonwealth, because of its abundant fertile soil. Before the planet could be fully made home, however, the colonists had to overcome a microbe infestation in the water supply. Unbeknownst to the first colonists, the waters were infested with micro-organisms that gave colonists a variety of short-term intestinal problems, dubbed "Roadkill." Once a person was over the sickness, however, he or she would never come down with it again. Microbiologists discovered that these microbes actually become part of the digestive system, helping the body become accustomed to some of the planet's indigenous plants and mammals. With more study, these same scientists were able to discover that the microbes had some beneficial effects on certain cancers of the stomach and digestive tract.&#xD; Roadside has only one large continent, named Columbine. Two thirds of Columbine has been turned into agricultural centers and ranches. Claremont, the planetary capital, is located centrally in the continent. The remaining third was designated as a health retreat and game preserve.&#xD; [3050] Aware that it could not win if it fought the Jade Falcons in a pitched battle, the Roadside Militia took to the hills when the Clan forces landed on-planet in June 3050. Splitting up into lance- and platoon-sized units, the militia set traps and ambushes and sprung them on individual Stars. Several Stars of the First Falcon Velites fell victim to these traps, but the surviving Falcons hunted down and killed every militia member in revenge for these dishonorable tactics. The Roadside Militia's sacrifice tied the First Velites down on the planet for almost two weeks.&#xD; [3064] During the Jade Falcon Incursion, General Archer Christifori, leading his own Avenger's and the Fifteenth Arcturan Guards, hit roadside on the 3rd of October 3064. A single trinary of the Jade Falcon Solahma Cluster held this world and was summarily destroyed when, while they were defending the Tyler Munitions Factory, General Christifori ordered his 'Mechs to fire on the facility. The resulting explosion killed every Clan MechWarrior and created a shockwave that was registered over most of the world.

    <Description>Robinson is a large, temperate world. The planet's fertile black soil attracted colonists early in the Exodus, but it did not take long before they realized that Robinson's real treasures were its hidden deposits of oil, precious metals, and rare minerals.&#xD; As a result, the farmers, who had already claimed a majority of the available lands, came into conflict with foreign companies eager to get at the hidden wealth. The crisis collapsed the planetary government, and brought David Sandoval, distinguished commander of the planetary militia, to prominence. After assuming the title "Lord Protector" and taking control of the remnants of government, Sandoval then seized the assets and properties of the foreign companies. He justified this with the claim that their negative influence had affected the quality of life on Robinson, and it was his duty to defend his world against them.&#xD; Lord Protector Sandoval then worked out a radical land reform bill that would gradually free more land for government exploitation every time land was bought or sold. The government eventually made a fortune mining the lands acquired through these transactions. The land-reform bill also made the Sandovals rich because they owned the only oil and mineral drilling company legally authorized to dig for resources on government land.&#xD; More conservative policies eventually balanced the situation toward property owners again, but the Sandoval family had, meanwhile, become the planet's noble rulers. Robinson, because of its political and economic importance, soon became the focus of considerable traffic. When the Federated Suns was split among the Five Princes, Robinson became the capital of the Terran March. The Sandovals' power continued through the chaos of the Five Princes Era. They even survived the Civil Wars with their titles intact, despite the fact that the Sandovals had been staunch Rostov supporters. As a result of the reorganization of the Federated Suns after the Civil War, Robinson became the capital of a greatly enlarged Draconis March.&#xD; Robinson has since lost a substantial portion of its surface to mining operations, which has limited its ability to export raw materials and grow its own foods. In exchange, Robinson quickly became a major industrial center. During the good years of the Star League, Robinson was a major source of finished metal products used in the construction of JumpShips and DropShips. It also had many smaller industries producing consumer items such as personal vehicles and appliances.&#xD; With the collapse of the Star League, Robinson fell before the invading Draconis Combine forces as they penetrated deep into the Federated Suns. The Kurita forces destroyed most of the planet's heavy industries in an effort to break the population's will to resist. Though many died of starvation or became military casualties, the people of Robinson mounted countless attacks against the Kurita occupiers.  Robinson was eventually liberated, but not before 70 percent of the planet's industrial capacity had been destroyed. Only recently has the damage of the first war been repaired enough to bring the planet's industrial might near to its earlier levels.&#xD; Robinson is also the center of Judaism in the Federated Suns. The famed Yeshiva of New Tel Aviv has continued its centuries-long study of the Talmud. Study at the Yeshiva is funded in large part by the nobility of Robinson and by the donations of the realm's many believers.&#xD; The Battle Academy has just recently come back from years of disuse and war damage. At the start of the First Succession War, the Battle Academy had just graduated its first class of officers. When the Draconis Combine took Robinson, the conquering soldiers gave special attention to the Battle Academy. In a series of actions intended to demoralize the people of Robinson, the Occupation Administrators of the Draconis Combine forced the few cadets who had not perished in the invasion to tear down the buildings of the Battle Academy with their bare hands. That it was impossible did not matter to the Kuritans.&#xD; It has taken these many years for the Battle Academy to be fully rebuilt and restated. In 3020, with the Robinson economy entering a prosperous period, the Sandoval family, Dukes of the planet and nominal controllers of the entire Draconis March, decided to reconstruct the school. They spared no effort to make it equal to anything at Albion or the College of Military Sciences on New Avalon.&#xD; The Battle Academy is currently commanded by Colonel David Sandoval.</Description>

Her orbital bombardment of Robsart's capital killed over 30 thousand civilians and destroyed any Star League hopes of an early peace.

    <Description>With vast mineral resources capable of sustaining a broad industrial base, and further blessed by an abundant water supply and soil rich enough for planting, Rochelle was an easy colony world to establish and settle in the early days of mankind's race to the stars. After the fall of the Terran Alliance, this world became a part of the Federation of Skye, thanks to a trading alliance with the McQuiston family on Skye, which further boosted its economic and industrial growth, until its subsequent conquest by the nearby Free Worlds League. &#xD; In the wars that followed the collapse of the original Star League, Rochelle and its material wealth were hotly contested, and it was particularly ravaged during the savagery of the First and Second Succession Wars. In fact, as the Second War finally ground to a halt, House Marik's economic experts concluded that the mining, refining, and manufacturing centers on Rochelle had become hopelessly damaged by the widespread use of weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, so much nuclear and chemical waste had been released in the past eight decades of warfare that the League officially classified Rochelle as "unsalvageable"; reconstruction efforts were soon abandoned, and the planet virtually evacuated. &#xD; Despite this, the proud people who remained on Rochelle, suffered through two centuries of war and death, but continued to mine valuable ore for export to industries deeper within the League. For a time, the world even became the headquarters of MediQuick, an interstellar mobile medical services corporation that offered its services to close to two dozen worlds on the Steiner-Marik border, until questionable business practices led to that company's demise. &#xD; Despite the best efforts of the locals, the economy and infrastructure of this tortured and poisoned world continued to erode, leaving it a mere border post for League military forces to guard against their Lyran counterparts. &#xD; The crumbling capital city of Arzenburg, is located on the northern continent of Caredon. Rochelle's other continent, the southern landmass of Martinasia, however, remains largely abandoned, thanks to the high radiation and acid rains, lasting effects of the first two Succession Wars.</Description>

    <HasFactory>false</HasFactory>
    <Description>The first colonists on Rochester were puzzled by the absence of life on a world with such plentiful water and potentially good soil. Then their own crops and animals began to die for unknown reasons. When the experts studied the water and soil to learn the causes, they discovered the presence of a variety of trace elements that, when combined, formed a deadly group of toxins. At that time, there existed no means to filter out or neutralize the poisons.&#xD; Though the planet had to be abandoned for years, a purification system developed during the early years of the Star League was capable of removing harmful agents from Rochester's water and soil. Rochester was resettled, and this time, the colony was a success. One of the byproducts of the purification process also became valuable. It was sludge that became known as "Green Jelly Gold" because it contained unusual elements highly sought after by pharmaceutical companies. By the time of the First Succession War, the colony had developed extensively, having spread a carpet of plant and animal life across nearly the entire planet.&#xD;  The Draconis Combine attacked and occupied Rochester during the First War and quickly destroyed the water and soil purification plants. This led to the rapid loss of plant and animal life, leaving the colonists helpless. The occupying forces of the Draconis Combine refused to feed or evacuate the colonists from their dying world. Fifty-two thousand colonists died in what came to be known as the Rochester Starvation. Only the Kentares Massacre surpassed this event in cruelty or in the anger it aroused in the people of the Federated Suns.&#xD; [3025]It is rumored that scientists from the NAIS have lately rediscovered the purification process that once gave life to Rochester and that they are about to test it there.&#xD; [3039] The Operation Orochi strike on Rochester had only one purpose: to cow the AFFS High Command into believing that the Combine was making a serious advance towards Robinson, the capital of the Draconis March and the Sandovals� ancestral home. &#xD; The only people that remained on the world were researchers looking to reverse the devastation caused during the First Succession War and miners, looking to exploit what few resources the world could provide. The only �defenders� the world could claim were territorial constables and the security forces that the mining concerns brought with them. Even the spaceport consisted of little more than an expanse of ferrocrete, one mere corner of the once-majestic spaceport that had fallen into ruin over the previous three centuries.&#xD; In fact, the term �strike� barely even applies to the Combine operations on the world. After leaving Breed in early August, the second battalion of the Fourth Ghost Regiment landed on Rochester, immediately taking command of the spaceport. They made a few additional reconnaissance raids against other settlements, though only to disable communications arrays and space-traffic control monitoring systems. That ensured that they were the only ones able to monitor what else was going on in the system, allowing them to easily trick the people of Rochester into believing that they were setting up a major forward base, capable of supporting a multi-regiment assault upon Robinson.&#xD; This news, in conjunction with all of the other sketchy intelligence reports detailing the Combine�s operations in the Draconis March, convinced the High Command to recall all forces that had been holding for orders to continue with their Wave Two assignments.&#xD; The Third Ceti Hussars RCT landed on Rochester in the last week of October, expecting to face a massive Combine invasion force. Indeed, they were under orders to delay the expected DCMS task force at all costs, as it would likely take months more before enough reinforcements could be drawn from the Crucis March. The Hussars were thus surprised to find only a battalion of �Mechs on the world. They made quick work of the Ghosts, who unsurprisingly retreated after putting up only a light resistance.&#xD; The Ghosts� mission had, of course, been successful. The gambit had paid off, and within just a few weeks, the few regiments assigned to Operation Orochi retreated back across the border, their goal complete.</Description>

    <Description>[3025] The city of Granite Falls on Rosamond is home to the enigma that is Interconnectedness Unlimited. For the past 50 years, the company has slowly been acquiring companies in a haphazard fashion. There is no apparent plan behind the company's actions, yet its acquired companies bloom into new productivity as soon as I.U. takes over. Attempts to establish a history for the company prior to 2971 have proven futile. It seems to have appeared fully grown on the planet Marlette in that year. Its first recorded action was acquisition of the Triple-F restaurant chain, a large and popular group of fast-food restaurants. It seems incredible, if not impossible, that a company with enough assets to swallow up a large and profitable restaurant chain could have blossomed overnight. &#xD; Any attempt to categorize Interconnectedness Unlimited would be futile. A description of some of its various divisions is more to the point. It is estimated that there are over 5,000 Triple-F Restaurants on over 250 worlds in the Federated Suns. The restaurants are famous for their Triple-F burgers, which are made out of whatever meat animal is common to the area. Triple-F is sometimes awarded food contracts by local military units. The Triple-F logo is instantly recognizable to anyone from the Federated Suns.&#xD; The D. Gently's Detective and Information Agency specializes in marital cases. Their many agents follow wayward spouses, deal with kidnappers, and deliver heartfelt sermons on the interconnectedness of all things. This is an homage to the company's founder, who lived about a thousand years ago and believed, quite rightly, that all things in the universe are related. Count Steffelbust is an avid follower of this "philosophy," which is why he acquired the company.&#xD; The Holy Order Press is the Federated Suns's third largest publisher of religious books. Though they have no formal affiliation with the Unfinished Book, several noted philosophers from that organization have published dissertations through the Holy Order Press. This has added considerably to the company's reputation, making it I.U.'s fastest-growing member.&#xD; Golden Star Entertainments is the largest producer of holofilms in the Federated Suns. Their huge movie studio, located just outside New Hollywood, cranks out at least 50 full-length feature films per year. These movies, of all types, quality, and ratings, are distributed throughout the realm.&#xD; There are an estimated 50 Golden Star hotels and gambling casinos scattered across the realm. Several investigations indicate that the various games are run honestly, as the hotel rooms and food are usually so expensive that there is no need for Golden Star to cheat in the casino. Rumor has it that the infamous Casimir family, a large organized crime syndicate based in the Lyran Commonwealth, has attempted to worm their way into the staff of the Golden Star Casino on Errai.</Description>

    <Description>During the Davion War of Succession in 2729, Federated Suns forces under the command of General Kessem and Prince Joseph Davion, finally linked up in the Royal system, catching the main Kurita force off-guard and inflicting heavy casualties. In a rash move, Joseph insisted on personally leading his forces in his Marauder. The Prince's 'Mech was disabled in the fight, and a malfunctioning ejection mechanism trapped Joseph inside as the Kuritans moved forward for the kill. With the death of the Prince, the Davion troops fled, and the Battle of Royal became a costly defeat for the Federated Suns.&#xD; Fortunately for House Davion, the Star League finally decided to take action. Elements of the Star League Regular Army - including an impressionable young MechWarrior Captain named Aleksandr Kerensky - arrived off Royal to impose a cease-fire between the two sides. The League council censured both sides for resolving the dispute by force, but House Kurita received the brunt of the criticism. All troops were ordered withdrawn to behind pre-war frontiers, and the Kurita claim to the Davion throne was refused once and for all.&#xD; [3039] The underground on Royal had long been supported by the Stephenson family, thanks not only to the fact that Royal was but a single jump away from their home on New Ivaarsen, but also because Royal and its people were part of Duke Stephenson�s landhold. When Prince Davion forbade Duke Paul Stephenson from dispatching his New Ivaarsen Chasseurs regiments to retake Royal after the Fourth Succession War, the duke nevertheless sent what aid he could to the world. While often that aid consisted of food, medications and spare parts for those who would not deal with the Combine, it did occasionally take the form of quasi-military operations to smuggle select individuals off-world or to engage in piracy or limited strikes against Combine interests.&#xD; When Prince Davion informed Duke Stephenson of the impending invasion of Royal, he secretly gathered together a force that would ensure that the world would fall with no problems. Even while his New Ivaarsen Chasseurs were given orders that would put them in place for action in the war, he recruited MechWarriors from both regiments to form a volunteer battalion and likewise put together a regiment of volunteers from New Ivaarsen�s militia. He then dispatched his son, Leto, to accompany Fuchida�s Fusiliers, which was assigned by the AFFS High Command to support the Royal action. Just before the Fusiliers jumped, Leto Stephenson signaled his father, who dispatched his volunteers almost immediately. &#xD; This both surprised and angered the Fusiliers, but before they had left, Duke Stephenson arranged to have his son, an AFFS colonel, assigned as their liaison officer. As soon as the volunteers arrived, Colonel Leto Stephenson assumed direct command of the Royal invasion. Resistance leaders had already learned through back-channels that their duke�s son was leading the invasion, and broadcast that fact across the world just as the first strikes were launched. This news brought a good percentage of Royal�s population directly into the fight, who defiantly stood up against the three conventional DCMS regiments on their world. And when Leto Stephenson was captured after leading the attack on the Combine headquarters in Port Sibut, it was Royal�s citizens that rallied together and quickly overran his captors, even though it cost more than five hundred civilian lives.&#xD; The fight for Royal was brief, consisting to many historians of little more than a footnote in history books, but it was significant because, in that five weeks of combat, it was the ordinary citizens of Royal that truly won the war on their world. They literally made it almost impossible for the Combine troops to operate effectively, giving the New Ivaarsen Volunteers and their duke�s son the ability to soundly crush their opponents.</Description>

Furs from this world, particularly that of the Rubigen red wolverine, are highly prized.  City Rubigen is the capital of the planet as well as the seat of the prefecture.  It is near the Bassers Glacier, which has been creeping toward the city at the alarming rate of one and one-half meters a year.

    <Description>Ruchbah�s surface is dominated by a single landmass and dotted with inland seas. Most of this landmass consists of rolling grasslands, hills, and tundra, ideal for grazing animals. Lit by a small subdwarf star, Ruchbah is a relatively cool world and its higher latitudes suffer bitterly cold winters, forcing both domesticated and wild herds to migrate annually. Because so much of its population follows the animal herds, the population of Ruchbah�s capital, Rook, and other towns varies widely depending on the season. &#xD; When first settled, Ruchbah�s native military consisted of little more than horse-mounted cavalry, which allowed the neighboring Tikonov Union to take control of Ruchbah in 2228. When the Tikonov Union joined the Capellan Confederation 150 years later, Ruchbah was one of several worlds that requested the protection of, and was eventually integrated into, the Terran Hegemony.&#xD; After the fall of the First Star League, the Federated Suns claimed Ruchbah, although the Capellan Confederation briefly held Ruchbah during the Third Succession War. The word was hit hard during the first two Succession Wars thanks to its status as a particularly prosperous former Terran Hegemony world. The heavily industrialized planet saw a nearly unstoppable cascade effect of interdependent companies wink out of existence when a few of the largest corporations, which either depended on other industry on the world to supply it with products or that supplied other companies with their own products, were outright destroyed.&#xD; [3067] Michaelson Heavy Industries may be a newcomer to the Federated Suns� military-industrial complex, but it has long been a productive member of the nation�s civilian industry. Various subsidiaries can trace their origins back to the Star League era, though the company as it is known today did not come into being until the last half of the 29th century.&#xD; The city of Michaelson, a center for manufacturing on Ruchbah, was hit particularly hard. Unemployment was higher than it had ever been and factories sat fallow, leading the city�s government and corporate leaders to a radical solution � at least for citizens and companies that had long operated successfully and freely under the Hegemony. They socialized the city, rebuilding their industrial infrastructure and ultimately putting both the people and the factories back to work. Within short order, this new Michaelson Heavy Industries assumed complete control of not only business within the city but also the city itself � which, since everyone but the politicians in the city worked for the company anyway, passed without significant opposition.&#xD; Michaelson continued on in that way for another century, manufacturing a wide variety of products, but even when operating as a miniature socialized nation the company could not continue indefinitely without outside aid. In the late 30th century the company went public, bringing in much needed investment capital that it immediately put into repairing its factories. That move, controversial since it would force the company officers to report to an outside board of directors, allowed Michaelson to survive the Succession Wars and once again become a corporate powerhouse.&#xD; For the last sixty years, Michaelson Heavy Industries has had great successes in the civilian sector. It is the one of the largest manufacturers of heavy construction equipment, and its popular lines of tools are sold throughout the Federated Suns. Likewise, its aircraft business saw great success. But following the Clan Invasion, Michaelson�s directors saw an opportunity to grow business even more. In 3051 it presented the AFFS with a number of prototype combat VTOLs; within a year it was churning out its first military vehicle, and by the end of the decade it was mass-producing four more.</Description>

    <Description>Seen from orbit, Rukbat is a wonderful expanse of endless oceans, tropical islands and small continents, with woodlands and green valleys aplenty. The majestic mountains, capped with only the slightest dusting of snow and ice, are treasure troves of minerals, and the seas are full of life. It therefore came as a surprise when the first colonists to set foot on Rukbat discovered their newfound paradise was thoroughly poisonous. The air, containing only slightly more nitrogen than Terran standard, was not a problem, but everything else, from the waters and soils to the native flora and fauna, was. &#xD; Scientists quickly realized that the alien biochemistry of Rukbat's diverse ecosystem was completely incompatible with humans, creating a serious problem for the settlers. Moreover, this incompatibility extended to the water and soil. Though purifiers could help negate the more nauseating effects of Rukbat's freshwater table, the soil, saturated with the byproducts of the native life forms, could not sustain the colonists' crops. To support the mining communities that sprang up around the extensive mountain chains, the inhabitants of Rukbat had to import all of their foodstuffs and obtain a healthy number of water purifiers. &#xD; Under the Terran Hegemony, during the height of the Star League, efforts were made to introduce genetically altered crops and livestock to Rukbat, but they met with only limited success. The altered crops, a bit more sustainable than the expensive, high-maintenance altered cattle, helped lessen Rukbat's nutritional woes, but the planet remained dependent on offworld meats and produce. Meanwhile, the mineral mining industry continued to grow, the basis for the large cities of New Glasgow and Korbensberg on the primary island continent of Schender Prime.&#xD; During the Amaris crisis, the Usurper's troops resorted to scorched-earth tactics, destroying Rukbat's few viable farms as they retreated from the liberating SLDF troops. The fall of the Star League and the onset of the Succession Wars worsened the situation, throwing the planet's precarious agricultural system into ruin once again. Never able to recover, Rukbat remains  dependent on its neighbor worlds for the basics of life.&#xD; The capital city of Oskart is located on Schender Minor, Rukbat's second largest island continent, located just south of Schender Prime. The planet's other major island continent, Melrin, lies mostly south of the equator.</Description>

    <Description>Its orbit slightly elongated by the powerful gravitational pull of three large gas giants, Ryde is a world of long, harsh winters, still tortured by the tectonic stresses of its own formation. Of its seven major landmasses - Breight, Larnea, and Lesser Dasentica in the northern hemisphere; Creos, Greater Dasentica, Kale, and Roschi in the south - only the Dasenticas and Kale are calm and warm enough to support cities. &#xD; The others, too far north and south of the equator, are covered almost year-round by snow and ice, which only melt to any great extent when the local volcanoes and geysers erupt, spewing molten rock and hot gases into the sky. Though these same eruptions and the occasional earthquake also shake up the populated continents, their lessened presence and correspondingly lessened pressures gave Ryde's settlers relatively safe access to an abundance of geothermal energy, as well as a source for easily accessible minerals that in turn fueled a very profitable chemical industry.&#xD; All three of Ryde's seas, the largest bodies of water on the planet, are steaming hot, tainted yellow by sulfur from geysers that regularly erupt beneath each. An abundance of other heavy metals, thrown into the mix by the odd submerged volcano, rendered these water sources useless to the early colonists, who were forced to import water from off-world, relying on ice ships and the like for their very survival. No doubt it was because of this that Ryde became home to a Water Pure facility.&#xD; Water Pure Industries, based on Corridan IV, found the chemical industry already established on Ryde, as well as its water problem, an ideal reason to set up shop on this world, and so built a massive purification plant just outside the capital city of Heaven's Gate on the Kale continent. Though this facility has been damaged over the years since, due to heavy raiding by forces from House Kurita throughout the Succession Wars, the Water Pure facility remains in operation, continuously cleansing the Heaven's Gate reservoirs that are fed by annual snowmelts.&#xD; Throughout the Succession Wars, Ryde's chemical industry, which produces everything from pharmaceuticals to specialized fuels and industrial-grade explosives, has made this world the subject of heavy fighting by the neighboring Steiner and Kurita realms. Its industrial importance, as well as its strategic location, led the Lyran Commonwealth to seed the planet with several armed outposts near major cities.</Description>

    <Description>[2864] During the lull at the end of the Second Succession War, Captain General Philippa Marik dispatched several of her surviving scientist enclaves to the devastated world of Ryerson to repair the planets industrial base. The level of recovery achieved by these teams was remarkable, and is largely responsible for the economic viability of Ryerson today.&#xD; [3038] Gathering on Granera before invading Ryerson in August 3038 � as part of the FWL�s campaign to re-conqueror the rogue Andurien province - the Second and Fourth Marik Militias expected to face the elite (but badly mauled) First Defenders of Andurien as well as planetary militias. Fortunately for them, Dame Catherine Humphreys realized the need to husband her forces for the final battle on Andurien, and she withdrew the defenders once the fate of Conquista and Sadurni was clear.&#xD; They still had to overcome the militia defenders, but this was a task they achieved quickly and efficiently, securing the world in just over four days � the fastest victory of the campaign. The speed and maneuverability of the Fourth Militia was central to the victory, allowing the loyalists to scout enemy positions. The Second would then maneuver into position for a conventional assault, pinning the militia in place while the Fourth struck the flanks and rear. Most of the militia units disintegrated when faced with such tactics, and 100 hours after the FWLM troops began operations the planetary authorities surrendered to the Captain-General.</Description>

Precious and rare metals, gems, minerals, and even more common ores were (and still are) in plentiful supply on this all-but lifeless rock. Initial reports of the world�s bounty were suppressed at the highest levels of government until it could be fully and properly exploited. Even after the mining and extraction contracts were issued and regular shipments began flowing, Sabanillas remained nearly devoid of people. Its high gravity, unbreathable atmosphere and cold environment � along with a five-and-a-half-week transit to its jump point � combine to keep all but the hardiest away from the world.&#xD; In fact, the majority of Sabanillas� people are all �family��miners and support personnel are born, raised, work and die on the world. Though the mining companies do not pay well or educate their workers, they provide their employees (and their families) plenty of potables, substances, and services that would be illegal on most other worlds � a fact that keeps the world�s population relatively happy. Owing to its remote location and proximity to some of the worst pirate areas in the Federated Suns, Sabanillas is occasionally subjected to raids; the on-world mining concerns maintain strong security both on the planet as well as in space, including powerful escort and patrol DropShip flights to ensure the security of shipments.</Description>

    <Description>Orbiting twin stars, each between three and four times the mass of Terra's Sol, it is a miracle that a potentially life-bearing world like Sabik could exist at all. Still, aside from a breathable atmosphere and a limited supply of free water, very little about Sabik was found to recommend this world for settlement during its initial surveys. The land, almost universally rugged and dry, with abrupt cliffs and mountains, interspersed by rocky badlands and the occasional asteroid crater, supported but one form of life: an exceptionally stubborn purple-leaved plant that carpets most of its deep valleys and chasms. &#xD; A disappointing lack of sizable mineral deposits, infertile soil, and high year-round temperatures kept away prospective colonists and industries. By the time of the Star League, only a handful of rugged frontier settlers had claimed this barren world as their home, where they eked out an existence by braving hazardous terrain and blazing heat to mine the planet's few veins of industrial metals. The Star League, however, saw value in Sabik as a potential base for military training and technological development, and established their Harsh Terrain Test Center and a Special Arms Services Training Center to test new BattleMechs, vehicles, and troops in its brutal environment. &#xD; After the League's collapse, the Draconis Combine assumed control of this world and established a small military presence for potential operations against the Lyran Commonwealth. Despite a minimum of population, ComStar established an HPG on this world, as they, too, took an interest in a planet abandoned by General Kerensky's departing fleet. What ComStar discovered, completely without the Dragon's knowledge, in fact, was the presence of an SLDF staging base, hidden well beneath the HTTC command center.&#xD; Today, this world is little more than an outpost, with no agricultural or mineral wealth worth exploiting, though some corporations have expressed an interest - as many before - in mining the hazardous asteroid belts, and using Sabik itself as a home for their local headquarters. Sabik has no continents per se, but boasts a single ocean in its northern hemisphere, Black Oasis, from which a number of minor rivers radiate across the otherwise barren surface. The capital of Mofestos, is located on the northern shores of this ocean, a mere 500 kilometers from the planet's north pole.</Description>

With no federal troops in the system, the miners used the mass accelerators (machines used to propel refined metals into Sackville orbit) to try to persuade the loyalists that they had chosen the wrong side.

Ocean-going vessels keep the lines of trade and communication open between the scattered settlements, with the core of planetary commercial and industrial energies, the spaceport city of Kamalabad, forming the hub of all traffic. &#xD; Kamalabad is located on the northwestern peninsula of Grangi, Sadachbia's largest northern continent. The planetary capital of Jalna'ir is located on the nearby island-continent of Banade. The planet also has one medium-sized equatorial continent, called Lossa, and two southern continents known as Dharma and Shoquelle. These continents support far fewer settlements than Grangi and Banade, largely due to the fact that they are either too warm during the summer months or because their terrain is too treacherous.</Description>

At the time, rainforests covered most of the world's landmasses in the middle latitudes - a paradise, compared to the rocky deserts and desolate grasslands these early colonists once called home. Hoping to establish a peaceful agrarian lifestyle, most of the first settlements revolved around farming and cattle ranching - a process made difficult when it soon became clear that most Terrestrial food crops simply wouldn't grow in the Sadalbarian soil.&#xD; Native crops eventually came to the fore, becoming a significant export item, and one of the planet's few contributions to the rest of populated space, until MediTech Industries, a pharmaceutical corporation in the Star League era, discovered that much of the world's rich jungles also offered great medicinal potential. Under a grant from the Star League, MediTech set up an elaborate research and development facility on the fringe of the massive Waltabu Valley jungle. This facility was abandoned after the fall of the League, but eventually reclaimed after the First Succession War, by a local medical research company called Sadalbari Solutions. &#xD; Today, Sadalbari Solutions operates a strong, interplanetary corporation that develops and sells everything from specialized dietary supplements to anti-cancer treatments. The company uses the former MediTech R&amp;D facility as its corporate headquarters, based on the large, northern continent of Aberlani.

Consequently, non-essential reconstruction on Sadurni itself did not commence until the late 3040s, and in a number of areas it remains incomplete even twenty years later.&#xD; [3038] Landing on Sadurni on 11 February 3038 � as part of the FWL�s campaign to re-conqueror the rogue Andurien province - the Eleventh Atrean Dragoons and the Eighth Orloff Grenadiers faced a single battalion of the Third Defenders of Andurien. They were warned against over-confidence, however, as the Third had put up stiff resistance on Xanthe III despite equally poor odds. The Third proved as tough an opponent as predicted, but without backup they were unable to repeat their success on Xanthe. They did, however, extract a price.&#xD; Rather than staging a stand-up fight, they broke into lance-sized units and scattered, forcing the pursuers to likewise break into miniature task forces to hunt them down. Working to a prearranged schedule, several of these lances would come together for a raid against a loyalist force before scattering again, inflicting a host of small wounds whose effect grew steadily. &#xD; These hit-and-run tactics could have continued indefinitely but the Eighth Orloff, already infamous on the Periphery border, fought back mercilessly, caring little for collateral damage to people and property. After less than two weeks of fighting, realizing that their tactics would only lead to civilian carnage, the Third Defenders abandoned Sadurni and chose instead to focus their efforts on protecting Andurien.</Description>

    <Description>When first discovered, Saffel was a rather cold world at the onset of a minor ice age. The first colonists were hardy folk from Terra's Siberian, Scandinavian and Canadian regions, who found the cooler temperatures reminiscent of their homelands and planned to build cities on the north polar continent of Dovejin, Saffel's largest landmass. This frigid land, half-covered in a glacial ice cap, was considered an ideal location due to the large metal deposits detected during early surveys. &#xD; Unfortunately, before these rich veins could be tapped, the so-called Outer Reaches Rebellion broke out, leading to the eventual collapse of the Terran Alliance's dominion over its far-flung worlds. With it went the fledgling settlements' only means of support. Unable to obtain the equipment necessary to turn their new home into an economically viable system and poorly equipped to handle their sudden, unasked-for independence as the harsh Saffel winter set in, many of these first colonists perished.&#xD; By the time the Terran Hegemony formed nearly 100 years later, the surviving population had migrated to the warmer equatorial zones, particularly the continents of Awonera and Sophrati. Eking out an existence in the rugged, thickly wooded plains of these new lands, the scattered communities didn't know what to make of the arrival of new settlers from the Hegemony, especially when these newcomers claimed the early cities that had been abandoned by their forebears. A brief brushfire conflict broke out between the old and new inhabitants of Saffel before the Hegemony government managed to negotiate a truce.&#xD; In the heyday of the Star League, Saffel became known as an exporter of valuable metals, as well as home to the Saffel Medical Institute. Located in the city of Radjik on Awonera, the SMI developed a revolutionary instrument, the Eligus Diagnoser, which was capable of rapidly scanning a patient's body, identifying any known ailments and rendering a diagnosis. Although it was withheld briefly to prevent a panic in the medical community, as some suspected the device could put doctors out of work, the eventual unveiling of the Eligus Diagnoser put Saffel on the map, adding valuable medical equipment to the planet's list of exports. &#xD; After the collapse of the Star League, Davion forces promptly seized Saffel and established the planet as a gathering point for troops in one of the first major campaigns against House Kurita. In response, the Combine launched a devastating attack in 2787 but failed to capture the planet. Over the following centuries, Saffel was raided and invaded several times but remained largely under the Davion sunburst until the Draconis Combine managed to take the planet after the War of 3039. &#xD; Saffel today is a peaceful world with a modest metal trade and a subsistence-level agricultural sector. The capital city of Iwanji, located on the southern coast of Dovejin, also serves as the largest commercial spaceport.</Description>

Created by a group of retired Star League officers in 2613, the Academy has willingly accepted anyone who can afford the tuition. During the First Succession War, the Sakhara Academy distinguished itself when its staff and students, about six regiments of mixed weapons, withstood and even repulsed three separate attacks by the vaunted 3rd Sword of Light 'Mech regiment and three other veteran Kurita regiments. This action, known in the academy as the Days of Jousting at Dragons, made the academy's reputation.&#xD; Today, though Sakhara can only turn out 20 MechWarriors and an equal numbers of pilots, armor, and infantry officers every year, the traditions and history of the school still carry much respect among the AFFS. Because the school is so small and so tradition-bound, graduates grow to love it and consider the four years there as the best years of their lives. Yet, the training is extremely tough, both mentally and physically.&#xD; The current commander of the Sakhara Academy is Commandant Lindsey Trevellis, a retired AFFS Colonel.</Description>

It eventually attracted a small but dedicated group of followers that ultimately left the Hegemony after Amaris seized control of Terra, relocating to the Federated Suns world of Kentares IV. It was thought to have been wiped out during the Kentares Massacre but resurfaced on Larned some fifty years after that tragedy. From there, the church and its congregation bounced from world to world like some sort of religious troupe for over a century, putting on a cross between a carnival and a metaphysical revival service.&#xD; Ultimately, it found a permanent home on Salem, where its followers put down roots and began recruiting from the industrial world�s population. It remains a relatively small religion, but one that has taken hold over the planet and has in the past directly affected Salem�s industrial output when the Church�s leaders have believed that their faithful have not been treated as fairly as they should.</Description>

    <Description>What little is known about the pirates of Santander's World is not very pleasant. Founded in 3019 by Helmar Valasek, an ex-Captain in one of House Davion's 'Mech regiments, Santander's World boasts one of the most viscous bands operating in the Periphery. After being charged with piracy, theft, and insubordination, Valasek and his entire company fled the Federated Suns, though not before carrying out a murderous raid on the regimental commander's family estate. &#xD; Unable to sell their services to any of the other Great Houses, Valasek and his men eventually settled on Santander V, under the command of Tiberion Tominga. After little more than a year, Valasek mutinied against Tiberion, killing him in a duel. He is now the undisputed master of the bone-dry world of Santander V. Valasek is impartial in his piracy, launching water and parts raids against worlds owned by both the Draconis Combine and Federated Suns.&#xD; Unlike most other pirate groups, much of Valasek's treasury consists of payments made for covert assassination attempts. Operating singly or in small groups, Santander assassins are known to have penetrated Davion and Kurita space to slaughter government officials and financiers. Where practical, Santander raiders engage in kidnapping, often stopping merchant vessels along traditional trade routes to remove wealthy passengers for later ransom. In addition, Valasek contracts for terrorist activities and may well have affiliations with various dissident groups within the Inner Sphere.&#xD; All members of Valasek's band take a blood oath to their murderous leader, vowing to die most horribly should they "squeal" on their fellows. More than once have the pirates killed their own members suspected of renouncing their pledge.&#xD; The Santander pirates are an irritant that the Successor States will probably destroy at the first opportunity. It is believed however, that Valasek maintains an intricate web of spies and informants that might tip off Valasek to any impending strike. Therefore, any such attack would have to be made with the utmost secrecy.</Description>

The Republic was preparing to relocate the factory a second time when Satalice was overrun. The chances of such a large-scale operation succeeding a second time were slim in any case. Clan Wolf was now bypassing planets in order to strike at choice targets such as Satalice more quickly, and the people of the Republic had lost much of their fighting spirit by this time. The fact that the elite Wolf Spiders and Forth Guards Cluster were chosen to take the planet shows that the ilKhan was determined to capture this factory intact.&#xD; Clan Wolf forces landed on Satalice in November 3051. Defending the world were the fanatical Third Drak�ns, and the First and second Satalice Armored Divisions. The commanders of the Forth Wolf Guards and Wolf Spiders dispensed with traditional bidding in favor of wagers based on which unit would bring back the most "trophies" from a battle. These were defined as the unit insignia ripped off the body of an enemy 'Mech. During the first few skirmishes �verste Adrian MacGalliard, commander of the Drak�ns, deduced that the two Clusters were not co-operating and shaped his strategy accordingly. He used his 'Mechs as bait to lure Clan warriors into ambushes. This strategy did not work for long because the ambushes had no effect against aerospace fighters.&#xD; The action on the Blue Lava Fields, north of Hamntrakt, was of great importance, though it was not immediately obvious. The Wolf Spiders chased a Drak�n company into the huge lava and geyser fields in the arctic region of the planet. There, Star commander Phelan Wolf defeated the Drak�n company commander in one-on-one combat. The name of the defeated Drak�n was Ragner Magnusson, son of Elected Prince Haakon Magnusson.

Its ground and space facilities at Mal Kham on Tamarind focus on spacecraft, while the factory complex on at Atlanta on Savannah assembles several BattleMech models. &#xD; The company�s experience in orbital manufacturing gave Technicron a head start in the production of advanced armor and chassis materials, but Technicron Military Engineering excels most in the manufacture of precision power plants. The division played a key role in the reintroduction of extra-light technologies, using them first with a licensed Pitban design and then expanding their use to other models. These endeavors also led to the development of several other engine technologies, boosting power-to-weight ratios and resilience, though none of these advanced systems are yet commercially available.&#xD; The desire for quality products prompted Technicron to acquire jump sail supplier Forerunner, A.G. in 3059. Quality control issues concerning sails for Impavido WarShips caused several significant delays, and with the tacit approval of the LCCC, Technicron staged a hostile takeover. The years since have seen slow but steady improvement in the reliability of Forerunner sails, their overly complex furling mechanism being replaced by a simpler and more robust model without compromising the sails� superlative power-transfer capabilities. The former management of Forerunner has staged several legal challenges to the takeover and their disenfranchisement, all of which have been dismissed.</Description>

    <Description>The start of the Third Succession War, in 2866, brought final changes in the Capellan armed forces. As the availability of trained manpower continued to diminish with each successive campaign, all the major Houses were forced to look to other sources for expert warriors. Mercenaries were the logical answer. Thus, more and more such units were incorporated within the regular framework of existing house armies. Eventually, these mercenary units equalled and in some cases exceeded the number of regular line regiments available.&#xD; Chancellor Otto Liao increased the use of mercenaries alongside regular Capellan units, and formalized the arrangements through charters, which specified rigid contractual conditions. Otto's initial efforts at chartering mercenaries away from other prospective employers were not always successful. In 2876, the 14th Aerospace regiment was hastily redeployed on Sax to destroy elements of Brighton's Rangers, after the Rangers broke the conditions of their original charter with the Capellan government.&#xD; This incident served as a powerful demonstration of Chancellor Otto's determination to enforce the terms of his contracts, in effect using mercenaries on his terms, not theirs.</Description>

    <Description>[3029] During the Forth Succession War, Captain-General Janos Marik was more than willing to sit back and let the other Houses destroy one-another. However, neither of the Captain-General�s Concord of Kapteyn allies cared much for this attitude. Strongly worded communiqu�s from Chancellor Liao and Coordinator Kurita convinced Janos Marik that he had no choice but to help both states. With great reluctance, the Captain-General set in motion what became Operation Dagger, aimed at pulling House Steiner units off the Draconis front.&#xD; Hugely successful, this operation netted Marik five Lyran worlds for very little cost. Things started going wrong when a clash occurred on Scarborough, between Marik forces and Capellan units taking refuge on the world. The Duchy of Andurien, always a volatile and rebellious member of the League, immediately declared war on the Capellan Confederation. In less than a day, the Captain-General went from successful conquest of several hard-won worlds, to fighting a desperate two-front war.&#xD; Ultimately, this clash cost the Free Worlds League fourteen worlds that might have been saved, as well as seriously damaging the Concord of Kapteyn partnership.&#xD; [3067] Once the home of Scarborough Manufacturing, the Whitby industrial complex was shattered in the First Succession War and in the years since has been home to little more than a scattering of light industries that use the workshops within the factory shell. Management of the facility lies in the hands of Scarborough Licensing, PLC, all that remains of the once-powerful manufacturer. For a fee, Scarborough allows small companies to use its facilities (and to display the Scarborough logo on products made there). &#xD; The licensing corporation also provides mail-forwarding and business registration services for companies that wish to use Scarborough as their legal base of operations � including no small number of foreign companies seeking to win coveted �FWL Company� status and avoid import taxes. One such company is the Scarborough Corporation in the Draconis Combine, whose legal headquarters are in the League, but which has its main factory complex on Al Na�ir. &#xD; The legal pretense allows the Combine-based corporation to maximize its profits in the League � its largest client � without having to physically relocate. This practice remains legal in the Free Worlds, if somewhat dubious. Some large companies such as IrTech have called for tighter regulation of �shell shops� like Scarborough, while companies in direct competition � such as the Exeter Corporation � have proposed an outright ban.</Description>

    <Description>A world of heavy rainfall, rich soils, and basic metals, Scheat became an industrialized world soon after the first colonists made planetfall. Lumber and common raw metals such as aluminum and iron made up the bulk of the planetary economy, with textiles forming a supplemental export. &#xD; Only moderately successful in comparison to neighboring systems, very little made this world stand out in the early years of human expansion into the galaxy. Many cities arose on the primary temperate continents of Kohl and Warschen, centered on the local timber industries and mining establishments, while agricultural settlements developed along the winding rivers that connected many of these cities.&#xD; In the days of the Terran Hegemony, Scheat was a Hegemony border world to the Draconis Combine, and so military outposts and a small 'Mech repair and refit complex were placed on the world for the benefit of defending troops. When the Star League fell, these assets became natural targets for the feuding Great Houses, and were largely destroyed in the fighting.&#xD; Only in the past decade have efforts to reclaim the devastated facilities borne fruit with the opening of Landhome Industrial 'Mech Enterprises, producer of construction, mining, and forestry 'Mech designs. The LIME plant is located on Waschen, while the planetary capital and primary spaceport lie in the foothills of Kohl. The large, lake-riddled equatorial continent of Rhodes is Scheat's only other major landmass, and it is home to the industrial city of Valorie, where Valorie Metals, Unlimited, Scheat's largest mining concern, is headquartered.</Description>

    <Description>Schedar is a cool, desert world. Although the chemical constituents of its atmosphere are suitable to humans, a fine mineral dust that scars human lungs permeates the lower atmosphere and forces Schedar's population to use filtering masks and equipment. Many small, salty lakes pockmark the surface, and Schedar's native reptilian life-forms migrate between these lakes as the seasons change. During the First Star League, the Federated Suns invited the Terran Hegemony to jointly administer Schedar, partly to ward off attacks from the Draconis Combine and partly to encourage Hegemony investment in this backwater world. &#xD; Taking advantage of the planet's low-wage workforce and the naturally occurring semiconductor minerals littered across Schedar's surface, a rich Hegemony family established Rander Communications Equipment, Inc. near the capital of Jacksonville. The Rander family also convinced the Hegemony to undertake some mild terraforming efforts on Schedar to rid the planet of its deadly mineral dust.&#xD; Although the fall of the First Star League brought an end to terraforming on Schedar, Rander Communication Equipment went on to faithfully serve the Federated Suns for the duration of the Succession Wars by producing various military electronics, including communications, tracking and targeting, and countermeasure systems. Although Rander had a subsidiary on the surface of Schedar that produced civilian electronics, its military electronics were produced in an underground factory.</Description>

    <Description>Schuyler is primarily an agricultural world, though does possess some heavier industries. &#xD; [3050] Clan Smoke Jaguar landed on Schuyler in June 3050. Defending the world were the survivors of the Third Alshain Regulars from Garstedt. The Jaguars intended to finish the Third, but the resupplied Regulars proved harder to defeat than the Jaguars expected. In a series of staged battles that lasted almost a week, the Third moved from spot to spot on the planet, forcing the Jaguars to expend energy and ammunition following and attacking hem.&#xD; The Regulars managed to inflict so much damage on the Seventh Dragoons' Assault Trinary that Star Colonel Nevversan broke his bid and called in an extra Trinary. Before the reinforcements caught up with the Third, the Regulars had lifted offworld, once again disappearing beyond the reach of the Jaguars.&#xD; The Smoke Jaguars enjoy using the Sai fighter, produced by Wakazashi Enterprises, but not because the design is particularly well-liked by the Clans. In fact they consider it an inferior craft. But using the Kuritans' own fighter against them is high comedy to the Jaguars.&#xD; Most likely, the Galileo lines that produce the Monarch and the Behemoth are being reworked. The Clans favor the use of the Achilles, however, and production of that DropShip will probably be accelerated.&#xD; [3059] During Operation Bulldog the First Genyosha, Davion Heavy Guards RCT, First St.Ives Lancers, Forth Wolf Guard Assault Cluster, Tenth Lyran Guards, and the Com Guards 91st Division assaulted Schuyler. The Nu Galaxy Command Trinary, and the Forth and Twelfth Jaguar Regulars put up a strong defense, but the Jaguars could not stand against such a concentration of force. For three days the SLDF advanced steadily, herding the Clanners ahead of them.&#xD; One Cluster broke at Olasin Fjord under pressure from the St. Ives Lancers, Wolf Guard and Com Guards. The second Cluster gained the Mitsuhama Ridge and looked determined to hold it. With the First Genyosha and Davion Heavy Guards flanking the Clan force, Precentor Martial Victor Steiner-Davion led his Tenth Lyran Guards against the Cluster. It was not until after the battle they realized they had fought an Omega Star of the Forth Jaguar Regulars, sacrificed so that the bulk of the Clan forces could escape.

    <Description>Seginus is a hot and steamy world with a single gigantic supercontinent, Teremun, that seems almost completely covered in rocky mountains, thick jungles, and swirling storms. Thunderstorms, hurricanes, and tornadoes constantly churn the water and pound the land on this world, varying in intensity between seasons, but seemingly never coming to an end. Settled in spite of its harsh climate and lack of mineral or metallurgical wealth, Seginus eventually came under the sway of the Federation of Skye, and later the Lyran Commonwealth, its people benefiting from the mercantile alliances that became the foundations of House Steiner.&#xD; For a short time the planet's greatest export, the Segine tempest swimmer, became a delicacy throughout the Federation, but like all fads, its fame and the economic boost to Seginus ran their course all too quickly. Nevertheless, the introduction to the interstellar community under House Steiner opened up this world to trade with its neighbors, though this was sorely hindered by the planet's sheer distance from a safe jump point. In addition, secondary stations were built in the system to serve as waypoints for incoming and outgoing traffic, breaking up the monotony of a month-long journey.&#xD; Unfortunately, these marvels of spacecraft engineering, with sophisticated equipment to maintain their unusual synchronous orbits between the jump points and the planet, no longer exist. All four stations were lost to the centuries of declining technology brought on by the Succession Wars - an ironic twist of fate, considering that Seginus's lack of military value and long in-system transit times made it a poor target for actual raids or invasions. Despite this, Seginus maintains a subsistence-level trade in its limited common metals and the frozen, freeze-dried, and prepackaged products of its marine ranching industries.&#xD; The capital city, Gambootas, is home not only to the planet's sole interstellar spaceport, but also to the corporate headquarters of Segine AquaCulture, the planet's largest marine ranching and food processing industry.</Description>

    <Description>In December of 3024, the LCAF pushed the last remaining Kurita 'Mechs off this large industrialized world.  Like most worlds that have suffered major 'Mech battles, whole portions of Sevren's surface are scarred wastelands of torn earth, uprooted trees, and buildings crushed beneath the weight of BattleMechs.  Sevren is large, however, and much of it still retains the planet's original character.  There is considerable agriculture here, despite the fact that the planet has only one small ocean.  What makes farming possible are countless freshwater springs and rivers running deep beneath the ground.  This allows the cultivation of land that otherwise would be nothing but barren desert.  Also deep beneath the ground are major deposits of radioactive and non-radioactive metals, which have created heavy industries for the manufacture of reactor cores for fission power plants and steel major parts.  Though much of the fighting did avoid damaging cities and industries, the destruction of the Nesmith Nuclear Industries nuclear processing plant has created enormous problems.  When the plant mysteriously exploded the day after the last Kurita DropShip left Sevren, it spewed radioactive debris over several square miles of the surrounding terrain.  The debris blanketed the nearby city of New Cartis, a major population center.  Relief efforts are underway to seal off the damaged plant and to scrub clean the city, a backbreaking task that will require enormous sums of money and at least three years' work. &#xD; [3051] Sevren, with its mineral deposits and abundant agriculture, was such a prestigious target that Khan Garth Radick pulled rank to win the bid for his Galaxy. Facing him was Hauptmann General Gilda Felra, a veteran of the Forth Succession War and the War of 3039, commander of the 25th Arcturan Guards RCT. When Beta Galaxy made their drop on the continent of Carlisle, the general hit them hard and fast at Dinton Acres. The battle, though inconclusive, effectively blunted the Wolves first offensive. The next series of battles were equally inconclusive. At Bassingdale, the Third Battle Cluster found an advantage and attacked a weak spot in the Arcturan Guards' line, overwhelming the defenders and cutting into the rear before General Felra could send reinforcements. The Arcturan Guards went on the defensive. Finally, after a battalion HQ was destroyed by headhunters in the battle of Mt. Ripchuk, General Felra and her troops retreated offworld to Colmar.</Description>

As a minor planet with few resources and little strategic value to the Draconis Combine, they had no military to defend them. In an all-night session with the terrified governors, football commissioner Jimmy "Straight Jim" Lorne proposed a bold plan. Confident that the Clans new nothing of the game of football, he suggested that the Sheliak Professional Football League challenge the invaders to a game. If the Clans won, they could claim the planet; if they lost, Sheliak would remain free of Clan occupation. Because it was the only chance they had, the governors agreed to Straight Jim's plan. &#xD; To their surprise, the Clans agreed to play. Straight Jim, however, had not counted on facing a team of eight-foot-tall Elementals, nor had he expected the Clans to know the rules of the game (few citizens of the Inner Sphere even suspected that the Clans would continue to play the sports common to 20th century Terra.) The dismayed leaders and people of Sheliak could only watch as the Ghost Bear team devastated the Sheliak All-Star team, 84 to 3.

During the great exodus, this timber lured people living in the great northwest of North America, northern China, and from Russian Siberia. Shensi would become an export leader of timber and iron ore. The three continents on the planet were covered with tens of thousands of kilometers of forest, yet the early settlers were able to carve out their new homes without damaging their new environment. &#xD; Klondike is the largest continent and is located on the equator and extends north. Its climate is the most temperate of the three. The capital city, Whitehorse, is located in the center of the continent. The continent of Mogot, where the Russian settlers colonized, produces the greatest amount of iron, titanium, and radioactive ores. Its climate is colder and it has fewer mountains. The northern expanses of the continent range far above the artic circle, where they exist as frozen tundra. Here petroleum wells have been drilled and oil stored for the world. On the continent of Kungara, enough of the landscape was open plains for various agricultural products to be grown to support the population. &#xD; When Shensi became a member of the Capellan Confederation, it brought much in the way of natural resources to support the fledgling realm. The CCAF recognized the value of the world and secretly built a number of hidden supply caches for strategic purposes. Shensi was lost to House Davion during the Fourth Succession War, but the locals never gave up the secret caches. When Shensi returned to the Confederation, their supplies was still there, save one cache that had been raided by pirates.</Description>

    <Description>[3057] A sparsely inhabited, forest-covered world with thick jungles around the equator, Sheratan is one of the most beautiful planets in the Sarna March.&#xD;The lush forests and jungles spring from fertile soil, ideal for growing fruits and vegetables from throughout the Inner Sphere. Agribusiness's such as Addicks Enterprises bought up acres of it, stripped the land of trees, and turned the bare tracts into huge farms. During the Marik-Liao invasion, it became one of the most bitterly contested.&#xD; The Sheratan Knights, a single regiment of warriors utterly dedicated to the Federated Commonwealth, defended Sheraton from both invading forces and internal rebellions. The planet had suffered a protracted terrorist campaign by various groups set up and funded by the Capellan secret police since the Forth Succession War, and so the Knights had superior training in dealing with guerrilla-style warfare. When the Capellan Chancellor ordered his agents on Sheratan into action concurrent with the invasion, bombings and mass shootings became commonplace in Sheratan's few large cities. The Sheratan Knights flushed out and destroyed many of the rebel cells, but vast forests and jungles gave the surviving Liao guerrilla plenty of places to hide.&#xD; The arrival of the Fist of Mokal, mercenaries in the employ of the Free Worlds League, turned the tables in the Liaoists' favor. Seeing that Sheratan was lightly defended, the mercenaries landed in the capital and claimed the world a Capellan possession. The enraged Knights converged on the capital and engaged the Fist in a hit-and-run battle, downing several mercenary 'Mechs. Stunned by the attack, Major William Jeffreys ordered two of his companies to chase the Sheraton Knights into the forests and hunt them down while the third company held the fort in the capital.&#xD; With the aid of the Liao guerrillas, the Fist MechWarriors found and destroyed a battalion of the Knights. The remaining Knights set the forests ablaze, trapping the mercenaries in a burning hell. Major Jeffreys ordered his unit to charge through the flames, but escaped with only a company intact. The inferno utterly destroyed the remaining Liao forces. The mercenary company in the capital retaliated by slaying thousands of civilians. When word of the brutal killings got out, the Fist of Mokal's contract was declared null and void and the unit itself was proscribed.&#xD; Before departing Sheratan, the Fist started fires of its own. Soon, vast tracts of land across the planet were burning out of control. Unable to cope with the crisis, the planetary government collapsed. Various minor nobles and other charismatic leaders rose up to fill the power vacuum, and numerous petty kings are constantly contending with each other for control of the world. Meanwhile, the fires continue to burn, kept at bay only near the cities. Most of the resources that could be used to fight the fires are instead spent on small-scale warfare between the various factions. Smoke from the huge blazes makes the days hazy and the nights unnaturally dark.&#xD; The Sheratan Knights remain the only potential stabilizing force on the planet, but they control only the shattered capital of Gellen's Heights and several square kilometers of surrounding territory. Rebel groups funded by the Capellan Confederation still operate on Sheratan, but the departure of the Marik mercenaries has greatly diminished their power.</Description>

    <Description>[3031] In addition to the Defenders of Andurien and her mercenary forces, Dame Humphreys also inherited several specialized FWLM units when Andurien seceded from the League � and began its joint invasion of the Capellan Confederation with the Magistracy of Canopus. Among these was one of the irregular �Liberation Units� whose personnel she unleashed on Shiba and Buenos Aires. Combining psychological warfare tactics with assassinations and sabotage, this small force quickly undermined the governments on both worlds and, having convinced the authorities that Sian had abandoned them, brought about their incorporation into Andurien.&#xD; [3034] The Fourth Defenders of Andurien achieved a remarkable feat of rebuilding on Shiba, managing to replace a significant proportion of their losses with a mix of repaired equipment and captured CCAF gear. Despite this, they had few illusions about their chance of success when the regiments of McCarron�s Armored Cavalry that had dealt with Primus 18 months earlier turned their attention to Shiba in February 3034. &#xD; Despite the long months of counter-insurgency operations, the Nightriders and Wild Ones were in good shape. The Fourth made preparations to withdraw, but before they could complete them the Liao mercenaries struck. Only a suicidal rearguard operation by two �Mech companies and an armor battalion held the Capellans long enough for the main body of Defenders to complete boarding operations and escape. The few Andurien survivors of the rearguard were treated in Capellan medical facilities and repatriated in 3035.</Description>

Together with its lack of resources, the climate of this world would have left it uninhabited had it not attracted the notice of the Exituri. The Exituri, a secretive, religious sect that blends elements from faiths as diverse as Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, and even Paganism, left Terra early in the Exodus for ideological reasons. Settling on Shiloh, the Exituri quickly established a theocratic society, based on their precepts, known collectively as the Bhagavad-Gita. &#xD; Shiloh became part of the Lyran Commonwealth�s Federation of Skye in the years leading up to the formation of the original Star League, but took little active role in interplanetary politics. The planet�s small population supported itself as best as possible, though their religious tenets limited them to using the most primitive means for farming and industry, while trade was limited to the export of local handcrafts in exchange for water. After the fall of the Star League and the beginnings of the Succession Wars, however, Shiloh became a target for frequent raids and invasions between Houses Steiner and Marik, eventually falling to the Free Worlds League in 2917.&#xD; During the centuries of Succession Wars, the Exituri leadership exerted near complete control over the world, despite numerous rebellions against the hard-liners of the government. At this time, the Exituri leadership of Shiloh preached often of the evils of advanced technology. They proclaimed that their Divinity no longer recognized mankind as a result of his increasing dependence on the tools of science and warfare, and they further condemned the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere, not just for the Succession Wars, but for all the tragedies of the human race.&#xD; The capital city of Shiloh is Randersville, and it is located on the north shore of Blessed Lake, in the northern hemisphere.</Description>

    <Description>A water-rich world with a single supercontinent and a host of nearby islands for its landmass, Shimonita is fairly unremarkable, its only outstanding feature a swirl of continuous storm activity that rages across the oceans and occasionally floods the coastal regions. For that reason, colonists established very few cities on the coastlines, preferring the interior regions of the Shangai continent, around freshwater seas and lakes that were far enough inland to be spared the worst of the planet's turbulent weather. The soils in those regions were fertile enough to support the population but were unable to sustain an export economy. Likewise, the valuable mineral veins discovered in the hills and mountains of the interior reaches were capable of subsistence-level trade but did not help the planet's economy excel in any real way. Nevertheless, the population of Shimonita grew. &#xD; In the following decades, the rising Ozawa Mercantile Association took interest in Shimonita after geologists discovered substantial metal ore deposits just off the Shangai shorelines. Despite the turbulent weather, the Association secured the rights to establish a number of ore mining rigs and submerged habitats along the southern and eastern shores of Shangai, where the most lucrative veins were located. The rise of the Draconis Combine and the defeat of the Ozawa clan brought these mining facilities under the dominion of the Dragon, but poor maintenance and the ravages of Shimonita's weather decimated them within a century.&#xD; Efforts by various corporations to revive the planet's offshore mining operations sputtered along during the Succession Wars, but few succeeded for more than a few decades.&#xD; The capital city of Shimonita, Irezumi City, is located on the southern shore of the Tranquil Sea, Shangai's largest inland body of water. The nearby city of Tranquil Bay is Shimonita's largest resort town and commercial center.</Description>

Jukemwa, almost covered in snow and ice, lay completely within Shinonoi's north polar zone, and early surveys deemed it virtually uninhabitable. &#xD; Nonetheless, a few hardy souls established towns on islands off Jukemwa, which today are among the planet's most successful fishing communities. Narosi, the smaller, equatorial continent where geologists discovered an abundance of mineral deposits and metal ores, became the heart of Shinonoi's mining and manufacturing industries and home to several sprawling metroplexes and factories, including the capital city of Marimasu.</Description>

    <Description>Shionoha is a forbidding world of rugged mountains, broken plateuas, and continent sized glaciers. The few small, lock-locked seas are as salty, ice-cold, and grey as the sky. The world owes its name to the Terran Japanese colonists who founded the first settlement at Kaigun close to the vast Shionohara. This large salt-plain marks the dry, mineral-encrusted basin of a long vanished ocean. Despite the planet's name, its predominant terrain is mountainous.&#xD; Shionoha's capital is Kaigun, which houses the world's principal starport and 'Mech repair facilities.&#xD; Though they have not been stationed on the world for years, the 2nd Dieron Regulars still maintains strong ties to Shionoha. Originally raised from the planet's population, the 2nd Dieron built its own MechWarrior academy, the Dieron district Gymnasium, in the city of Shiona. A small facility, it turns out fifteen to twenty highly trained MechWarriors every year, most of whom end up in Dieron District Regular Forces. The school emphasizes combat training and prides itself on bringing out a warrior's personal drive to excel. A side effect of this approach is an almost complete disregard for its students' political and philosophical learnings. To combat the possibility of potential subversives entering the DCMS, the ISF posts at least one agent at the Gymnasium at all times.</Description>

After discovering the mistake, they immediately began exploring the system and discovered that the fifth planet was rich in resources and water. They named the planet after the Captain, Jonathan Shipka, when they filed the claim for the planet. &#xD; Shipka's location made it a perfect way station trading port for the numerous worlds surrounding the system. The population exploded, with farmers, traders, crafters, and merchants looking to turn a fast profit. So diverse was the population coming to this new world that they named the capital Shipka Commune. This city is located on the southwestern coast of Cambridge, the largest of the planet's three continents.&#xD; Cambridge itself produces agricultural products and minerals in addition to having the largest DropPort on the planet. Hillsborough and Foxborough are almost identical. Where Cambridge is located in northern hemisphere, both Hillsborough and Foxborough are in the southern hemisphere. Hillsborough produces petroleum and precious metals. Foxborough produces timber and agricultural produce, as well as coal and shale. During the Fourth Succession War, Shipka fell to Davion forces. During the Davion occupation, Shipka continued to serve as it had while a Capellan world. When the Sarna March collapsed, the people of Shipka did not hesitate to return to their former home, throwing off the Davion yoke.</Description>

    <Description>Founded by a group of corporations in the early days of deep-space colonization, Shitara, a world of large landmasses covered with arid mountains, expansive deserts and winding grasslands, was not settled for its appearance but for its potential as a regional commercial hub. Shitara's five main continents - Agito, Hokaido, Niijo, Okasaki and Zumi - all fall within the world's temperate, tropical and equatorial zones but lack many inland freshwater bodies. The rugged terrain and relative lack of suitable irrigation made colonies difficult to establish, but the corporate engineers who laid out the design for Shitara's settlement were less concerned with comfort than with setting up business operations. Several of the planet's first colonies, as a result, were large warehouses, spaceports and mining/refining stations. &#xD; In the decades that followed, as Shitara became a jumping-off point for further colonial expansion and a center for trade, more settlers came to call this world home. Large commercial cities arose, particularly along the river valleys of Okasaki and Zumi, including the present-day capital of Hirotomi. Even a few agricultural communities began to appear to support the local population. Located well within the Draconis Combine's borders after that nation expanded to include it and its neighbors, Shitara was spared much of the fighting during the Amaris crisis and the Succession Wars. Raids by the Dragon's enemies were rare, and Shitara prospered, its nearly thirty major spaceport cities making it an ideal hub for commercial and military transport.&#xD; Today, Shitara continues to be a transportation and commercial hub, with major cities and spaceports on all five continents. Recently, the planet's robust economy and healthy metal resources have attracted the attention of Klein Manufacturing, a small but growing producer of industrial vehicles, including ConstructionMechs and MiningMechs. Klein Manufacturing is currently negotiating with the Shitara government to establish a major factory complex in the foothills of Agito, just outside the commercial city of Galveston.</Description>

In an effort to avoid total ruin, Hellespont relocated its remaining factory workers and production equipment on the more easily defensible capital of the Sian Commonality. Rather than trying to rebuild all the plants lost during the war, Hellespont moved away from 'Mech production into the manufacture of less expensive, more easily constructible armed hovercraft and tanks such as the Vedette.&#xD; Hellespont is today the single largest producer of armored fighting vehicles in the Capellan state. Though in recent years the company has again taken on 'Mech research and development, principally in the salvaging and improvement of captured 'Mechs, corporate emphasis remains the production of lighter vehicles.</Description>

    <Description>The worlds of Sierra, Cerillos, and Galisteo make up the Trinity worlds, also known as the Southwestern Worlds. These hot, dry worlds had once been a bandit kingdom, styling itself the Intendancy of New Spain, prior to being conquered and absorbed by the Free Worlds League. This did much to win the fledging League acceptance from the Southwesterners' long suffering neighbors. &#xD; The bulk of Trinitarians, red, white and brown were descended from residents of the ancient Terran states of Chiluahua, New Mexico, Arizona, and Sonora. The population is a curious mix of Cowboys, nortenos, Indians, and Jewboys. These Jewish Cowboys descended from Israeli refugees who didn't want to go along when many Jews went over to the Catholic church in protest against certain actions by the state of Israel back on Terra. Not wanting anything to with Orthodox Jews ever again, who they blamed for troubles back home, they decided to get as far away from them as they could. &#xD; Santa F� is the capital of Sierra.&#xD; [3025] Located near the Lyran border, the sparsely developed, sleepy world of Sierra is one of the main trade routes from Marik space into the Periphery. It has an unusually large population of ex-spacers who are willing to share their knowledge of the mysterious "beyond." It has become a tradition that traders who return successfully to this port, give a cut to anyone whose advice directly contributed to their success. This practice has surely increased the group's willingness to talk to outsiders.&#xD; [3035] Perhaps encouraged by LIC operatives, the Circinus Federation chose the tail end of 3035 to resume their raiding against the Free Worlds. The Trinity worlds bore the brunt of these raids, the most significant of which was against Sierra. Although considered outsiders by the native population, the Fifth Oriente Hussars fought valiantly despite the dishonorable tactics employed by the invaders. A counter-raid against Clayborne II that leveled several military facilities (and the palace of a petty lord) convinced the Circinians to cut back on their attacks while solidifying the relationship between the Fifth and the Sierran population.</Description>

For centuries, leaders of House Liao came to Sigma Mare, pronounced its potentialities impressive, and then left without actually doing anything to develop them.&#xD; In recent years, there has been political intrigues here, but they are apparently local in nature; galactic politics seem to hold little interest for the natives.&#xD; Horse breeders have established themselves on Sigma Mare, though on a smaller scale than on Turin.&#xD; [3031] Previously based on Capella, the Second Confederation Reserve Cavalry was one of several units shifted to counter the Andurien incursion. Its placement on Sigma Mare was an educated guess and one that seemed inspired when the Fourth&#xD;Defenders of Andurien attacked the world. Alerted to the presence of the intruders well in advance of their DropShip�s arrival, the Second moved to beat back the incursion when the Andurien troops were at their weakest and least organized during the landing operations.&#xD; Anticipating the Defenders� landing zone, the CCAF were a scant dozen kilometers from the LZ when the drive plumes of the transports were spotted descending through the clouds. Cheering their good luck, the Second moved to contest the landing, advancing to within only two thousand meters of the first spheroid to land. Steeling themselves, the Second prepared to pounce � and were unexpectedly struck in the rear by an Andurien formation.&#xD; The Defenders� �Mech contingent had staged an orbit-to-surface drop onto Sigma Mare a dozen hours before the DropShips descended and were moving to link up with the transports when their scouts spotted the �sneaky� Second. The possibility of catching the Liao unit between the hammer of the Fourth and the anvil of the DropShips was an opportunity too good to be missed, and Lieutenant General Nogales ordered his troops to hold back until the opportune moment. The Confederation unit shattered and fled, the survivors reaching their DropShips and escaping off-world two days after the bungled assault on the LZ. The CCAF subsequently prosecuted the Cavalry�s commander for gross negligence, though official Liao records deny the Sigma Mare disaster ever happened.&#xD; [3032] Simultaneously with the assault on Drozan in March 3032, Liao unleashed assaults on the Andurien troops, hoping to throw them back as well. The first world targeted was Sigma Mare, taken by the Fourth Defenders a year earlier. Blandford�s Grenadiers fully expected to face the Andurien unit, their task to pin it in place while other forces counterattacked the invaders� positions.

    <Description>There are two popular explanations of how the pleasant, temperate planet of Simpson Desert got its name, neither of which is correct. The planet was first explored by Professor Waldo Wadenius Simpson, a distinguished botanist, whose DropShip landed in a desert area. The story goes that Professor Simpson mistakenly thought it was a desert world, thus the name.&#xD; It is also said that Professor Simpson, upon arriving on the planet and finding how fertile it was, decided to use the old Iceland / Greenland switch, giving the productive world an unattractive name to ward off raiders. This reflects as badly on Professor Simpson's honesty as the other story reflects on his intelligence.&#xD; The truth of the matter is that the name resulted from a typo. In the desert, Simpson discovered a new spice, Simpson's Delight (Waldonia Simpsonis), which is now in demand throughout the Inner Sphere. Justly famous as a flavoring agent, the bittersweet leaves of this plant were first used in a delicacy called Simpson Dessert, from which the planet got its name. Somehow, during the registration process with the bureaucracy of the Terran Hegemony, one 's' was dropped from the name, and Simpson Dessert became Simpson Desert.</Description>

    <Description>[3062] With their area of responsibility including the largest salient into Capellan territory, the Sirdar CMM has not lacked for combat. Over the past century, the militia has fought CCAF forces on sixty-two occasions, ranging from small lance-on-lance engagements to pitched battles. The unit believes prevention is better than a cure and has taken part in numerous tactical assaults against Liao positions. The unit has been rebuilt five times but always gets up for more, earning them a formidable reputation in the PDZ.&#xD; [3063] Originally meant to be a quick operation, the battle for Sirdar turned into a long and bloody affair early on in the Civil War. The headquarters world for the entire PDZ, Sirdar was more importantly the logistics center for the region. In contrast to many other PDZ logistics centers, the Department of the Quartermaster had built a decentralized system on Sirdar, with dumps scattered over the world.&#xD; Allied forces under the command of Fleet Admiral William Cossacks landed on Sirdar in April 3063, and quickly secured the capital of Selkirk and the attached AFFC Edgewood Military Complex. The defending Sirdar CMM were steadily ground down over the next two weeks, with almost a full brigade being destroyed.&#xD; The battle entered its second phase in May 3063, when the Loyalist 4th Donegal Guards and Second Chisholm's Raiders arrived in-system on the 5th. In response Kossacks called for reinforcements, and reluctantly went of the defensive.  Though the Forth and Twenty-First Illician Lancers took heavy casualties in the intervening month, they survived until support reached them in late May. The Davion Light Guards arrived first, followed by the First Federated Suns Armored Cavalry and the Ninth Illician Lancers a week later. Their arrival turned the battle well in favor of the Allies. &#xD; From the moment his forces landed, Kossacks went on the offensive and inflicted severe damage on the Loyalist forces. Despite receiving more reinforcements of their own General's Amelio and Eisner, commanders of the Loyalist forces, eventually realized the battle was lost and began preparations to leave Sirdar by the end of July.&#xD; The battle of Sirdar brought the equivalent of some eight RCT�s well more than a hundred thousand men, into direct conflict with each other. While many other battles would eclipse that of Sirdar in both size and importance, Sirdar was certainly the largest battle of the early Civil War. Moreover, the battles were still governed by the morals and common principles of war � concepts that would soon be thrown to the winds.</Description>

    <Description>A rarity in the galaxy, made more so by its ultrahot blue sun, the Sirius system actually features two inhabited worlds for the price of one, though this was not the case when the twin worlds of Sirius VI and its moon, Sirius VI-a, were discovered in the late twenty-second century. Colonization of the moon's surface began before any such efforts on the planet itself, as Sirius VI a featured a breathable, if thin-atmosphere, and water covered almost half its surface. &#xD; Meanwhile, the seismically unstable, oxygen-poor planet below, identified only as a resource for raw metals, minerals, and gemstones, waited almost fifty years before serious efforts to terraform it began. Oxygen factories and sulfur-hungry algae helped to transform Sirius VI into a more human-friendly environment in the space of a century, though it remained water-poor and cursed by chronic earthquakes and volcanic activity. In the course of this time, the mining colonists of the planet and the farmers who came to inhabit the moon developed a symbiotic relationship, and travel between the two worlds was many times more frequent than any contact with the rest of the galaxy. In addition, two orbital colonies, placed around Sirius VI by the mining corporations - colloquially dubbed "The Projects" - made an interesting waystation between the moon-dwellers and the planet-dwellers. &#xD; Sirius became an important part of the Hegemony's industrial and economic base during the age of the Star League, but suffered badly during the Amaris coup. The orbital colonies were destroyed by Amaris aerofighters, and the planet was cut off from its moon by a blockade that led to widespread starvation. After the Capellans took the system in the wake of the League's fall, the situation on the planet only grew worse, as oxygen generators began to fail over time and the seismic activity tore open many of the planetary settlements.&#xD; Fought over by the Capellans, the Free Worlds League, and the Federated Commonwealth, little was done to cure the planet's worsening condition, and by the time of the Commonwealth's demise, Sirius VI had become an almost totally deserted wasteland of broken, shifting land masses and rivers of volcanic lava. Today, Sirius VI's only remaining settlement is the domed city of Calgary, on the south bank of the Sulfur Sea, the planet's only large body of water. By contrast, the moon is broken into two main continents, Bounty and Hinterlands, covered with a patchwork of forests and grasslands, that support the bulk of the population, which lives in sparse farming communities. The capital city, Lost Hope, is located on Bounty's eastern peninsula.</Description>

    <Description>[3052] The defeat of the Third Drak�ns, who had twice faced Clan Wolf and escaped, was given top priority by the Clan warriors. They were particularly interested in the unit because they hoped that the destruction of one of the few remaining Rasalhague 'Mech regiments, accompanied by the news of Prince Ragnar's capture, would demoralize the rest of the Free Rasalhague Republic.&#xD; The bidding for the right to take Skandia, the homeworld of the Drak�ns, was intense but restrained. The task fell to the Bronze Keshik, and the Seventh and 16th Battle Clusters of Gamma Galaxy commanded by Galaxy Commander Mikel Fury, in February 3052. Defending the world were the Third Drak�ns and the First, Second, and Third Skandia Royal Militia Brigades.&#xD; The fight for Skandia was tough and unforgiving.

    <Description>In most respects, Skat is an unremarkable world with four large continents covering almost half the planetary surface, three tiny asteroid moons in close orbit, and slightly more ozone in the atmosphere than healthy for breathing without either respirators or specialized anti-oxidant medication. &#xD; The planet's first settlers actually hailed from two distinct colonial groups - one of Japanese and Korean descent, and the other from a combined German-Austrian venture. The groups staked out two separate continents for settlement, with the Japanese and Koreans claiming the southern landmass of Quayling, and the German-Austrian group claiming Freiheim. The two colonial groups expanded to the other two continents of Uchida and Unzervalt, over the next several decades, when a dispute over fishing territory and an island chain finally erupted into open conflict during the Age of War.&#xD; The conflict was settled thanks to intervention by the Terran Hegemony, and Skat became part of that alliance until the fall of the Star League. Today, after falling under the dominion of Houses Davion and Kurita in turn during the Succession Wars, Skat's dominantly Germanic and Asian population continues to maintain a dual-cultural world. After rising and falling from prominence as the House Lords changed, the cities of Aneheim, along Freiheim's Kirschner River, and Inyong City, on Quayling's southern coast, once again form the twin capitals of the planet. Skat's largest spaceport, Jinyiang, is located on Uchida, while the city of Londerhalt is arguably the planet's largest industrial center.</Description>

An agricultural center, Skokie was expected to be an easy conquest. The Skokie tank regiments lived down to this expectation by fleeing rather than fighting. Both regiments were easily subdued, with few losses on either side. A local variant of meningitis, named the Skokie Shivers for the shaking its victims suffer, accomplished what the tanks failed to attempt.

    <Description>An abundance of rare mineral deposits and industrial-grade metals made Skondia a prize to the European and African colonists who first settled this world during humanity's exodus into space. Within a decade of the first settlers' arrival, in fact, the planet's first cities had already become industrial centers with dozens of businesses involved in the mining and refining of steel, titanium, and nickel-alloy materials used in everything from kitchen utensils to spacecraft and fusion engine manufacturing. Not surprisingly, this wealth soon drew the interest of the Federation of Skye.&#xD; Unfortunately, Skondia had long since become part of the rising dragon, having been claimed by the Draconis Combine in one of its earliest conquests. Over the centuries following the Federation's transformation into the Lyran Commonwealth, Houses Kurita and Steiner warred over control of this valuable resource world, with Steiner claiming it during the Age of War and through the Star League era. After the fall of the League, the Combine moved to reclaim Skondia in 2786, with a brutal assault campaign directed first against the civilian populace, and then against the planet's industries when the slow-moving Lyrans tried to intercede. &#xD; The results of an easy conquest convinced then-Coordinator Minoru Kurita that House Steiner was too weak to present a worthy challenge to his Draconis Combine, and ironically turned the might of the Dragon away more effectively than a spirited defense might have. Over the following centuries of the Succession Wars, Skondia would be assaulted and raided many more times, but the world remained in the hands of the Draconis Combine.&#xD; The capital of Skondia, Platinum City, is located on the southeastern continent of Steen. While this city boasts an impressive spaceport less than five kilometers to its north, most shipping traffic is routed through Passageway, a sprawling megalopolis on the northern continent of Edel.</Description>

    <Description>Much more than just the capital of the Federation of Skye, Skye is the emotional heartland of many millions descended from Scottish-English-Irish ancestors. For them, the bleak green hills and cold, misty mornings on Skye were the closest thing to heaven outside of Scotland on Terra. The many succeeding generations on Skye have developed a deep emotional attachment to this world of contrasting landscapes, beneath twin suns.&#xD; Despite all the publicity given to the planet's unspoiled landscape, Skye is a very industrialized planet. There are enough smelters, refineries, and  manufacturers to make any greedy businessman's heart happy. To counter the effects of these potential environmental disasters, the early founders of the planet kept over 50 percent of the planet wild and untamed. While this saved the land, it stifled economic prosperity and kept wealth in the hands of certain nobles and businessmen. Who was rich and who was poor has remained static for the hundreds of years since. This has made the social hierarchy rigid and stagnant, with few people able to move up the social ladder and many more actually descending.&#xD; In late 2892, House Kurita launched its only major offensive against Skye. Three 'Mech regiments and twelve lesser units defended the planet, against them Coordinator Taragi Kurita sent five 'Mech regiments and 19 armor and infantry regiments. The Kurita soldiers encountered difficulties almost immediately after landing, as Commonwealth units responded with a fierceness never seen before. Particularly disturbing was the population's fanatical devotion to their world.&#xD; Almost every day, the Skye guerrillas carried out some act of terrorism or sabotage against the occupying force. To this day, Commonwealth historians have not decided whether it was the shining moment of the LCAF, or its darkest day. The Steiner forces committed many atrocities, including the 'accidental' deaths of Kurita prisoners and the use of a tactical nuclear device to prevent a Kuritan thrust near Iverness.&#xD; Though partisan actions slowed the offensive, it was eventually the unpredictable winter weather in the capital of New Glasgow that caused the most setbacks to the Kuritan forces. The crucial battle occurred at the Bannockburn Bogs. A Kurita 'Mech battalion accompanied by a tank regiment was sent to take New Glasgow. After fighting off an attack from the 17th Skye Rangers, the Kuritan forces were spread out over a large front as they began their march on the capital.&#xD; As night fell, the Kuritan forces found their way blocked by a vast bog. They had no alternative but to stop for the night to encamp on a series of narrow concrete highways. During the night, Commonwealth troops moved into the bogs along paths only they knew. Surrounded and lined up like targets on the narrow roads, the Kuritans were badly mauled in the battle and forced to retreat. Though the struggle for the planet lasted another year, the Kuritan forces never regained the advantage. The cost of the campaign finally proved too much for the new Coordinator, and in early 2894, he reluctantly ordered his troops off the planet.&#xD; [3025] The economic boom created by the Commonwealth's alliance with the Federated Suns has created considerable social unrest on Skye. Though many welcome the  opportunity for stimulating new influences, and hope for eventual social, economic, and land reforms, others still consider the Federated Suns an enemy. These hold rigidly to the old ways of doing things, including defending the wilderness to the death. Despite this clash, every long-time citizen of Skye has the same deep attachment to the planet and most born there never contemplate leaving it.&#xD; Skye is also home to the Sanglamore military academy. Another former Star League academy, Sanglamore is the twin of the Nagelring. During House Kurita's attempt to take the planet, the academy was so damaged that it was no longer able to train Naval officers. Since then, Sanglamore has concentrated on producing the best MechWarriors and Warrant Officers possible. Though officially a Commonwealth academy, the school has a strong undercurrent of Federation separatist sentiment, with many graduates actively seeking to join the Skye Rangers.&#xD; Raina University on Skye is the Lyran center for AeroSpace research. Its graduates usually go on to become the moving forces behind efforts to rediscover the technology of DropShip and JumpShip construction.&#xD;&#xD;The EarCandy Company of Skye, is the largest producer of musical and sensory recordings in the Commonwealth.</Description>

Sodus was Captain Yoshido's homeworld, and he was overjoyed at the news. A few days before the Hussars arrived, however, a crowd of hooligans bent on "ridding the planet of Asian scum" brutally murdered Captain Yoshido's parents, owners of a small electronic firm. The rest of the Yoshido family was in the base hospital, some of them barely clinging to life. Witnesses later described Captain Yoshido's expression as contorted with hatred and anger after he visited them in the hospital.&#xD; By a cruel coincidence, another anti-Asian riot occurred that day in the city's main square. The usual band of ruffians had seized ten Oriental-looking men and women and were about to lynch them on a crudely constructed gallows. As the thugs were ready to hang their first victim, a bolt from a laser pistol caught one of them full in the face. Confused, the mob looked about but could see nothing. Suddenly, a figure dressed in a Special Forces uniform rushed the gallows from among some nearby trees. With a laser pistol in one hand and a cutlass in the other, the figure shot and slashed its way up to the gallows, leaving behind him a wake of dead and wounded. The man cut down the noose and freed the hostages before the mob could react.&#xD; As he was about to have his revenge upon the leader of the anti-Asian gang, however, the rescuer was stabbed from behind. At that moment, three Davion 'Mechs lumbered into the city square.&#xD; The mob was about to kill the wounded Captain Yoshido and recapture the freed hostages, when the three 'Mechs, all from Yoshido's lance, moved forward and swatted them away from the dying commander. One gently picked up Captain Yoshido in his 'Mech's hand and hurried to the hospital, while the other two MechWarriors stood over the hostages until help arrived.&#xD; Captain Yoshido died of his wounds. The story of his plight was picked up by the major Davion news services and broadcast realm-wide. Even Prince Davion was moved by the courage of Captain Yoshido.

    <Description>Though this tropical planet was originally settled as a resort world by members of Tikonov aristocracy in the early 27th century, a high concentration of fissionable materials was discovered on Sonnia.  This led to the rapid development of local nuclear-oriented industries.  Today, Sonnia remains heavily garrisoned by Davion reserves, though the exact reason for the planet's continued importance is unclear.  One possible explanation is that, topographically, Sonnia presents a wider variety of terrain than nearly any known world, making it ideal for training practice maneuvers.  Paradoxically, no major battle has ever been fought on Sonnia.  The natives seem to have a pragmatic political approach that could almost be mistaken for indifference.  That is, when asked to swear allegiance to Liao, they did so and went on with their business.  When later told they must then owe allegiance to Davion, they were equally cooperative.  Belying this easy-going attitude is the fact that the planet's most popular game is "Counter-Spy: the Game of Switching Sides."

With rebel forces being driven back along the front, all the Dragoon's gains had been lost by the end of the year.</Description>

    <Description>[3050] The world of Soverzene demonstrated to Clan Ghost Bear what Inner Sphere forces could do when truly motivated. The Second Alshain Regulars, the planet's usual defending force, had received reinforcement from the Twenty-seventh Dieron Regulars. The commanders of both units were determined to make the Clans pay dearly for this world, which supplied many of the district's raw materials. Tai-sa Jasick Yoshiro and Tai-sa Ano Tars planned a mobile defense in order to take advantage of the supplies they had stashed in various caches on the world's main continent. When the Bears arrived insystem in October 3050, Khan Jorgensson skipped the bidding process and committed the whole of Beta Galaxy to take the world.&#xD; The Dieron Regulars were assigned to protect the city of Averti and so moved to head off the Twelfth Bear Chevaliers and Fourteenth Battle Cluster, as the Clan forces lunged toward their objectives. Using air strikes, the Twenty-seventh herded the two Clusters toward the Killimangero fjords near Averti. Aware they were being manipulated, the Bears approached cautiously. The Twenty-seventh sprung their ambush at the edge of the narrow waterways. Using jump-capable 'Mechs to bait the trap, the detonated explosives sending most a Trinaries worth of 'Mechs tumbling down into the fjord.&#xD; Unfortunately for the Twenty-seventh, few Omnis were actually destroyed. To make matters worse, the Fourteenth Battle Cluster had flanked them to the east. Escaping through rough-hewn tunnels, the Twenty-seventh emerged on the far side of the fjord and detonated explosives in the tunnels, atop the pursuing Bears. They returned to Averti believing themselves victorious, only to lose the city to the Bears later that night in a nearly bloodless surprise attack. The Ghost Bear commanders had sent Elementals into the tunnels during the fighting in the fjord, and those troopers had disarmed the majority of the Combine's planted explosives.&#xD; The Second Alshain Regulars fared even worse against the 304th and 332nd Assault Clusters. The Bears hounded the mobile Second and forced them to retreat to their ammunition supply base, by doing so allowing the Bears to get a fix on the base's location and destroy it with aerospace assets. Now running out of ammo, the Second retreated north with the 304th in hot pursuit. Clan aerospace elements forced the Second into a forest where the 332nd awaited their opponents' arrival. Trapped between two full-strength Assault Clusters, the Second Alshain Regulars took heavy losses.&#xD; Those soldiers who managed to escape destruction staged a rescue mission at Averti, freeing the Combine's captured soldiers and equipment from the Twenty-seventh. The Bears spent nearly two weeks hunting down the renegades, but gave up the search when their Bloodnamed warriors were recalled to Strana Mechty to elect a new ilKhan. Elements of the Twenty-seventh and Second managed to escape the planet, but both suffered devastating losses.</Description>

When the vibrabombs failed to explode, the Knights were forced to retreat to their fallback position in Swerve Pass.&#xD; The Bears Alpha Striker Star, 141st Striker Trinary, followed them straight into the firing line of the Knights' infantry battalion. The Bears used their jump jets for the first time, rising out of the pass onto the ledges from which the infantry troops were firing at them. With the infantry's defeat, the remaining 'Mech forces fell quickly.&#xD; The Ghost Bears were not impressed with the prize they won on Spittal. The vehicles produced at the Benson and Bjorn plant are crude by Clan standards, even discounting the fact that the vehicles still use internal combustion engines.&#xD; The Bears are continuing production here, but they have no plans to upgrade the plant, considering it not worth the effort.

    <Description>From the moment it was colonized, St. Andre was at the forefront of interstellar politics. This was remarkable for a planet that was effectively a desert world. Most of St. Andre's two continents are covered in red desert. &#xD; On the northern continent of Ravensglade, the terrain is flat and featureless. Because Ravensglade is located above the arctic circle, it is cold and frozen for six months of the year.&#xD; Ravensglade produces petroleum and coal, as well as a small amount of uranium. Only a small portion of St. Andre's population lives on Ravensglade.&#xD; Most of the planet's population is located on Georama, the larger and more hospitable of the two continents. Situated in the southern and equatorial regions, Georama is a hot desert environment in contrast with its northern neighbor. The capital of St. Andre is Jerome, located on Georama. Originally a small commercial settlement, Jerome later became the planet's capital. It maintains a modest spaceport and sees to the harvesting and exporting of Andrean Ironwood, from the subtropical forests along the equatorial belt.&#xD; St. Andre's prestige comes from its early days, when Capella and the Sarna Supremacy were at war. Elite troops from St. Andre were used to aid the worlds Palos and Wei in 2305. It was on St. Andre that the leaders from the Sarna Supremacy, the Tikonov Grand Union, the Liao Protectorate, the Sian, and the St. Ives governments voted on and formed the Capellan Confederation in July 2366.&#xD; St.Andre's population was still less than 500 million in 2579 when the world was identified by Ian Cameron and Terrance Liao as a strategic site for one of the early Star League military bases. Industrial growth was rapid after this, with a large percentage of the planet's gross domestic product hinging on the supply and maintenance of several Star League facilities scattered across its habitable surface.&#xD; This age of prosperity ended, however, with the unprecedented brutality of the First Succession War. St.Andre, with its military facilities, its ship yards, its 'Mech factories, received special attention from several of the competing would-be First Lords. The surface of the world today is dotted with the scorched and charred ruins of cities obliterated during repeated raids and invasions.&#xD; By the end of the Second Succession War in 2863, scant industry remained on St.Andre. Those factories which survived were geared more to the necessities of survival than to those of war. St.Andre had, after all, a harsh climate, and a certain level of technology was necessary simply to preserve human life. The old Star League facilities have been obliterated. Some by repeated 'Mech attacks and firestorms and bombings, many by the radioactive hells unleashed by both strategic and tactical nuclear strikes. There were endless rumors of 'lostech' sites, places where half-magical, high-tech treasures of the Star League had been gathered safe from hostile marauders, and for many years St.Andre has attracted treasure hunters and speculators from across the Inner Sphere.&#xD; The planet became an object of Davion focus in 3007, when they sent the Dragoons to raid the megafactory of Seluk Electronics Ltd. Then, during the Fourth Succession War, Davion forces invaded and captured the planet. When the Federated Commonwealth split, the Capellan banner flew over St. Andre once again.</Description>

    <Description>[2621] Though the economies of the six member states prospered under the Department of Economic Relations, it was not enough for First Lord Nicholas Cameron. Following his father's vision, Nicholas announced in 2621 his intention to finish uniting the member states' economies by creating the Star League Dollar. This became the standard currency everywhere. The member states were allowed to print the new currency for their own realms under close supervision, but the Star League government determined the amount.&#xD; First Lord Nicholas also set up the central Stock Exchange (CSE), which allowed ten regional exchange businesses to trade shares in foreign companies. In addition to aiding the economy, the exchanges were supposed to promote peace between the realms, as having economic interests in neighboring states made war less attractive.&#xD; The Central Stock Exchange was located in the Terran city of London. The other stock exchanges and the Star League mints were set up on border worlds between the member states. They were grouped into commerce cities built by the Star League for the use of economists, brokers, and company executives. The cities' protection came from the SLDF, which usually had a major military base nearby.&#xD; Profitica on Stanzach, was one such city; it's mint produced currency for both the Lyran Commonwealth and Draconis Combine. With collapse of the Star League, the border world locations of the commerce cities proved to be their downfall, as they soon became targets. Profitica was destroyed early in the First Succession War.&#xD; [3050] Clan Wolf landed on Stanzach in October 3050. An important economic center of the FRR, Stanzach should have been a difficult world to conquer. Fear of the Clan invasion, however, reawakened old hatreds between the planet's Scandinavian and Oriental populations. Though the tanks and soldiers of the First Stanzach Armored Division showed flashes of the true strength, the unwillingness of the two factions to bury their grievances for the duration of the conflict caused frequent "miscommunications" and some outright mutiny.&#xD; Kirund is the capital of Stanzach.</Description>

    <Description>Star's End was first settled in the aftermath of the Reunification war by survivors of the bitter conflict between the Star League Defense Force and troops from the Rim Worlds Republic. Bent on vengeance against the Inner Sphere, they lived on the spoils of raids against the two Star League member states closest to them - the Lyran Commonwealth and the Draconis Combine. Over the years, these men and women embraced piracy as a way of life.&#xD; Star's End is a barren, desolate world shielded by a dense asteroid field, salted with minefields and laser turrets. The system is also rocked by frequent ion storms that make orbital navigation hazardous. Because of its inconspicuous appearance and the danger in transiting the system, this small rock of a world was an ideal base for the collection of space marauders known as the Belt Pirates, under the command of Morgan Fletcher.&#xD; As the supplies of spare parts, especially for jump vessels, slowed to a trickle, the Belt Pirates became aware that their livelihood depended on the technical expertise to repair and replace malfunctioning avionics equipment. Though numerous pirates have been killed while plying their trade, the technology of building and repairing JumpShips is by no means lost in the Belt. Hidden within the Trojan points of the Belt are zero-G docks and hangers, capable of actually reassembling functional JumpShips from scavenged components.&#xD; Star's End has proven to be a blessing in disguise to its owners. Beginning in the mid 2880's, massive deposits of germanium, which is essential for starship construction, were reported in locations under the planet's southern ice cap. In the decades since, there have been rumors of vast underground mining and industrial complexes that stretch from the polar cap to the equator.</Description>

The Falcons honored Colonel Carranza by challenging him according to the rules of the batchall, in March 3050. Carranza falsely claimed that he commanded a brigade of crack 'Mech troops. In response, Galaxy commander Angeline Mattlov reluctantly added the Twelfth Falcon Regulars to her own Eighth Falcon Regulars to invade Steelton.&#xD; The Falcon invasion targeted Cregan's Bluff, the capital of this cold, icy world, and the Lear Mountain mine works to the south of the city. Anticipating an attack from Colonel Carranza's non-existent 'Mech brigade, the Falcon's advanced slowly. The two Clusters did not co-operate, and seemed as interested in hindering each other's progress as in attacking the enemy. "Crab" Carranza's deception finally failed when the Twelfth Falcon Regular's heavy 'Mechs overran his second battalion at the town of Chosin. The Twelfth Star Guards managed to hold a perimeter around Red Stain Rock long enough for nearly a battalion of their unit and a regiment of the local militia to evacuate to the planet Wotan, but the Twelfth could not prevent their gallant Colonel's death.&#xD; [3064] During the Falcon Incursion, Khan Vladimir Ward's Wolves attempted to make inroads into the Falcon's Occupation Zone.

Lollan, Travis, Grebuchin and Harbor are the other four main cities on the northern continent. The planet's main starport is situated to the north of the capital, though both Travis and Lollan have smaller ports. With a population of almost half a million, Steinsdown has a fair sized fishing industry, but the peninsula except for area around the capital, is poor for farming. Lollan and Travis are planet's main farming areas. Most of the Folly's population is employed as service personnel in cities and ports, the rest being farmers.&#xD; The Highland Peninsula region on which Steinsdown is situated, is rugged and mountainous on its east coast and comes down to just a little isthmus, just 50 kilometers wide, named Folly�s Neck. The only major route through the isthmus is the so called �Coast Road�, passing through the narrow Jordan�s Pass, which links all the cities together.&#xD; North of the peninsula is the Ordolo basin. The Ordolo river meanders south from the Yaeger Mountains, and the whole, vast bole between the mountains all the way to the equator is one enormous swamp. The area is also home to dense jungle, marshes and the wetlands area known as the "Lost Lakes". During the planets wet season (the winter monthes of the year), most of the lakes run together, making it almost impossible to keep track of the shorelines.&#xD; Stein's Folly possesses three other continents. Thelan and Maris are large tropical islands. Lying to the south of the Highland Peninsula, both have several large cities. At the antipodes is Talliferro, a small continent that has a large mining settlement and commercial spaceport.</Description>

The colony�s early rulers formed the Stewart Confederation, a six-world nation that became a rival to the Marik Commonwealth. Indeed, the Stewart family could easily have played a more substantial role in the affairs of the Free Worlds League than eventually transpired had not David Genovese publicly derided the nascent federation and brought the wrath of Juliano Marik down on his people. In the centuries that followed, Stewart regained its influence, via mercantile rather than political or military means. Only in this century, with the marriage of Ana Stewart to Captain-General Janos Marik, has House Stewart found itself firmly ensconced near the pinnacle of League affairs, and a number of Marik-Stewart descendants have taken up key military and political posts in the League.&#xD; Corean Enterprises is the best-known company on Stewart, famed for its Locust and Trebuchet �Mech designs as well as for providing components to many other League manufacturers. A substantial and diverse civilian engineering industry also exists on-world, manufacturing and assembling everything from groundcars and blue-water naval vessels to consumer electronics and white goods. Combined with substantial agriculture�a far cry from the colony�s early days�the net result is one of the most self-sufficient worlds in the League. Even tourism has flourished on Stewart, though the kitsch fake clansmen of Highland and Lothian (who claim to �accurately recreate ancient Scotland�) are frequently mocked.</Description>

    <Description>J.B. BattleMechs was founded in 3053 by Jillianne Suliben, the daughter of a wealthy Tamar entrepreneur killed during the Clan invasion. Ms. Suliben started her company after purchasing the plans and molds for the venerable Chameleon training 'Mech design from Defiance of Hesperus. Using extensive connections and financial support from the defense-obsessed FedCom government, she refurbished an ancient manufacturing plant at Godenboro on Storfors into a BattleMech factory and produced her first run of new Chameleons in early 3056, followed soon by the first runs of the new Dragon Fire heavy 'Mech design.&#xD; In the early 3060s, at the request of then-Archon Katherine Steiner-Davion, J.B. BattleMechs supported a similar refurbishing effort for the endangered Red Devil Industries plant on Pandora. In exchange for loan guarantees and government orders, as well as a joint license for any new BattleMech designs spawned by the effort, J.B. BattleMechs carried out the request, but the investment of time and resources soon proved disastrous when Clan Jade Falcon seized Pandora within months after the renovations were complete.&#xD; The fall of Pandora, though a military disaster, flooded J.B. BattleMechs with new orders originally slated for Red Devil Industries. Landgrave Suliben has since initiated a massive hiring spree to boost her company's manpower and bring up production to meet the demands caused by the attrition of the Falcon Incursion and the recent civil war.</Description>

    <Description>The ugliest effects of House Kurita's invasion into the Federated Suns were psychological. Among the Davion citizenry, there developed an unreasoning greed, secrecy, suspicion, and a widespread compulsion to steal supplies. A particularly wicked case in point occurred on Strawn.&#xD; In 2794, a fifth-rate petty bureaucrat, who had somehow managed to become Prime Minister of Strawn, issued an order that stripped all members of the Oriental race of their property and belongings and relocated them to camps away from sensitive government facilities.&#xD; This law struck a responsive chord among the people now so desperately afraid of the Kurita Dragon. Suddenly, anyone of Oriental lineage was a potential agent of the Draconis Combine. The Capellans were equally feared since they had cut off the Suns's bond with Terra. In the resulting hysteria, many unfortunates were accused of being an agent of both realms. Paranoia spread like wildfire. Homes were burned, businesses bombed, and even a pasta factory was shut down because its noodles were declared "oriental". For those citizens of the Federated Suns who happened to be of Oriental ancestry, this was far from a laughing matter. Many were dragged from their homes and killed, while others watched as everything they had worked for was taken from them.&#xD; There were mixed reactions from the various planetary governments and nobility. Most were outraged by the citizens' actions and tried to stop the madness. Others took advantage of the situation, profiting from their Oriental citizens' misfortunes. A few governments and nobles actually believed in the Purge, and the history of these worlds will forever be stained by innocent blood.&#xD; After two years, the problem had so intensified that even the preoccupied Davion government could no longer ignore it. In January 2796, Prince John issued a proclamation that any form of racism was contrary to the right of freedom granted every citizen of the realm. Later, Pope Clement XX of the New Avalon Catholic Church issued a similar decree, claiming that racism could not coexist with the love of God and was therefore punishable by excommunication.&#xD; Though these actions served to calm the mania that had overtaken so many ordinary men and women, nothing could make up for the lost lives and property. To this day, there are very few willing to discuss the Purge in the Federated Suns.</Description>

On these worlds, the Archon sent in elite commando, marine and anti-terrorist units - ostensibly to maintain order, though in actuality to simply kill the offenders and impose a harsh martial law. &#xD; Even in the relative calm of the Draconis March, the Archon�s reach was felt full-force.

Styk is also home to Tao MechWorks, once the third-largest BattleMech production center in the Confederation. &#xD; Styk is a heavily industrialized world composed of nine continents. These landmasses cover 22 percent of Styk's surface; saltwater oceans cover the rest. Styk's continents were named after the original explorers who found the planet. The largest continent is Burtnik, where the planetary capital, Lorelei, is located. Just outside of Lorelei is Tao MechWorks and one of the planet's largest military and commercial DropPorts.&#xD; The remaining continents of Deyoung, Shaw, Young, Curulewski, Gowan, Panozzo North, Panozzo South, and Sucherman are heavily industrialized and each have their own DropPorts. One well-kept secret is Styk's ocean liners. Styk has a fleet of luxury liners that sail the vast oceans from port to port.&#xD; Today, Shitara continues to be a transportation and commercial hub, with major cities and spaceports on all five continents. Recently, the planet's robust economy and healthy metal resources have attracted the attention of Klein Manufacturing, a small but growing producer of industrial vehicles, including ConstructionMechs and MiningMechs.

    <Description>Styx was aptly named by the first settlers to set up colonies on its storm-ravaged surface. Large oceans and the gravitational effects of its three moons are blamed for the violent storms that rage across the Stygian surface, often causing damage from flash floods and mudslides during the planet's rainy seasons. The first colonists, as a result, settled in the open plains of the interior regions of Epimethius, the primary continent, where the storms were least volatile. &#xD; A few short years after the first towns were established, geologists discovered high quantities of metal and radioactive minerals in the mountain ranges of Epimethius and the smaller, neighboring continent of Perdition. These deposits lured in mining firms, the largest of which was the Styx Mining Company, an interstellar corporation that specialized in mining difficult veins of valuable metals and quality refining processes. Styx came under the sway of the Terran Hegemony more than a century before the birth of the Star League, and its mineral wealth helped bolster the Hegemony's economy and military. Perhaps for this reason, the Draconis Combine came to covet Styx, culminating in the first true battle to use the BattleMech. &#xD; In 2443, a Combine armored company raided Styx, intending to seize and plunder several metal refineries on Perdition while testing the resolve of the Hegemony. The rain-slicked plains slowed the Kuritan tanks, which gave the Hegemony troops plenty of time to ready their new war machines. On the muddy plains outside the city of Barbados, the two forces clashed: a lance of Hegemony 'Mechs from the 801st Heavy Armored Regiment faced off against a full company of Combine tanks and infantry support. The results were so lopsided that few could argue the Hegemony's new BattleMech would not be the future king of the battlefield. The four 'Mechs easily trampled the entire Kuritan force, leaving only a single tank and some of its supporting infantry to scurry back to their DropShip.&#xD; Styx's mineral wealth attracted many raiders over the centuries, including a major engagement between Kurita and Davion forces over the Styx Mining Company's Beta facility near the city of Lake Wio. Despite this, Styx remains a major exporter of metals and radioactive minerals today. The Styx Mining Corporation's headquarters are in Memphis, on Epimethius. The planetary capital, Sunder Falls, is located 120 kilometers northwest of Memphis. Aside from Epimethius and Perdition, Styx's third large landmass is the island continent of Gehenna. Far less populous than the other two regions, Gehenna is home to a large spaceport city, Lindon's Folly, which is also home to one of the Styx Mining Company's large refineries.</Description>

    <Description>When Sudeten was first surveyed, its extreme changes in atmospheric weather patterns were major concerns. Upon further investigation, however, these concerns were considered acceptable risks due to the wealth of untapped resources Sudeten held. Some of the new colonists likened the planet's climate to that of the Highlands of old Scotland in the British Isles on Terra. Sudeten was found to have massive ore deposits and petroleum resources, which have made the planet an important world for the Tamar Pact.&#xD; Sudeten has three continents, two of which are settled. Dargoth and Holcomb are large continents where most of Sudeten's resources are found. On Dargoth, the rebuilt Star League BattleMech factory, Olivetti Weaponry, close to the planetary capital of Patterson, is now operational. On Holcomb, Trellshire Heavy Industries is located just outside of the Compton Iron Ore Mines. Dagroth and Holcomb produce most of the planet's food supplies.&#xD; In the southern polar region is the continent of Cheragain. This inhospitable continent offers nothing but a cold harsh environment that no one wants. Most of this continent is covered in thick ice flows. Here Lake Sudeten is situated between the Cheragain Ice Flows and the Kadaicha Mountain Range.&#xD; [3050] The Gray Death Legion, one of the best mercenary units in the Inner Sphere, defended Sudeten by fighting a series of delaying actions to maul the Turkina Keshik and 124th Striker Cluster. The Legion escaped off-planet after the Sudeten Militia's 'Mech company sacrificed itself to hold off the Falcons long enough for the mercenaries to board their DropShips.&#xD; The Olivetti Weaponry factory is actually a recently restored Star League 'Mech plant. Outdated by Clan standards, this factory appears to have some value to the Jade Falcons.&#xD; [3060] Sudeten has become the Jade Falcon's "provincial capital" within the Inner Sphere.</Description>

    <Description>Suk II is another strategic border world in the Tamar Pact. Scattered over its five continents are several key rare metal deposits that have become tempting targets for raiders from the Draconis Combine. These raiders drop into the vicinity of the mines, steal whole boxcars of metal ore before shooting up the mining machinery, and then they retreat.&#xD; Suk is a very hospitable planet, except for one major problem: over 50 percent of the world's water supplies are tainted with a toxin excreted by a common algae native to the world. Costly purification systems are required to filter the toxins and the algae out of the water. To no one's surprise, the water refineries have become another favorite target of Kurita raiders. Many cities have moved their water purification plants to the middle of nearby military bases or have disguised them to protect the vital and complex machines.&#xD; [3025] The planet is currently the headquarters of Hansen's Roughriders, a famed mercenary regiment. Relations between the mercenaries and the citizens have been fairly cordial, considering the rather rough-house nature of the 'Mech regiment. That may all change because of the recent murders of two women in Kevilston, a city near the headquarters of the Roughriders. The evidence presented by the planetary government seems to indicate that a Roughrider is responsible for the women's death. As yet, the regiment's commanding officers have not turned over the suspected MechWarrior to the planet's authorities. The tension between the two sides grows measurably with each passing day.&#xD; Suk II is also home to the Suk Requiem Believers religious sect, who have melded Tantric Buddhism with Christianity with unique results.&#xD; [3052] Khan Natasha Kerensky had no illusions about the 33rd Avalon Hussars RCT, who defended Suk II. She knew they were a tough and determined collection of regiments, led by a four-battalion regiment of heavy 'Mechs. She prepared for a long, drawn-out campaign by choosing landing zones far from the expected defenses of the Hussars, then cautiously approaching the heavily populated eastern seaboard of Suk II's largest continent. When the fighting commenced, it proved to be just as difficult as the Khan expected. Logistics became a nightmare for Alpha Galaxy as they used up most of their supplies, particularly ammunition, during the first week of battle.&#xD; The supply situation became so bad that Khan Kerensky ordered all 'Mech's reconfigured with energy weapons only, leaving what little autocannon ammunition and missiles that remained for special assault Stars. Alpha Galaxy eventually prevailed when its Elementals made a massed attack against a Hussar regiment of low tanks. The Elementals paved the way for the Galaxy's light and fast OmniMechs to attack the Hussars' rear. Hauptmann General John Yapt signaled retreat when his situation became irretrievable, and the Hussars went offworld to Orkney.&#xD; The conflict itself lasted for almost the whole of January and February 3052, one of the longest campaigns waged by Clan Wolf in the entire invasion.</Description>

    <Description>Though its sun is a cool M-class star, Summer�s close orbital path and an ever-decreasing ozone layer have made this world much warmer than one might expect. The surface of this world is rocky, with numerous mountain chains making overland travel difficult between the major cities that have sprung up over all four major continents. These cities, almost invariably located near oil fields and the veins of radioactive ores that crisscross the planet�s lowlands, have formed the core of Summer�s economy ever since the planet was established, during the first Terran exodus. &#xD; Unfortunately, infertile soil, capable only of supporting a native purple scrub grass � limited the planet�s agricultural endeavors and forced the early settlers to form trading partnerships with nearby worlds to feed their industrial expansion. Summer�s export industry of oil, and radioactive materials, both crude and refined for fuels, easily helped address this need and made it one of the more valuable worlds of the Federation of Skye, even before that nation helped form the Lyran Commonwealth. &#xD; During the height of the original Star League, the discovery of germanium deposits in the Balise Mountains, on the southern continent of Wessler, made this world a manufacturing center for JumpShip components as well, further boosting an already soaring economy and rating the planet not only a heavy garrison of Star League troops, but a few Castles Brian as well. Unfortunately, most of these facilities were destroyed during the Amaris coup, but enough survived to make Summer a valuable prize as part of the Lyran Commonwealth.&#xD; Despite centuries of Succession Wars, when it became a favored staging ground for Steiner attacks on House Kurita, Summer miraculously maintained much of its industry. However, the output of its aging refineries, damaged by Kuritan raids on more than one occasion, began to gradually weaken the planet�s already thin ozone layer. The additional ecological impact of heavy DropShip traffic, made necessary by the planet�s rough geography and the presence of ten active spaceports, has only furthered this decline and is largely blamed for the increasing temperatures that make Summer a world more than worthy of its name. &#xD; The capital of Curitiba is located on the Lestrade continent � named for the powerful family that once ruled the world. It is also home to Summer InterStellar Components, who produce various JumpShip parts.</Description>

Calling itself the 'Proud Sovereign World of Summit', its people demanded independent status. The rebels killed their Duke, a loyal Archon's man, while the majority of the populace rioted against government installations. Instead of helping to quell the riots, the planetary garrison, with its lance of light 'Mechs, joined the fight, and even led the attacks against government offices and military bases. &#xD; Archon Giovani Steiner had to send in the entire 26th Lyran Guard regiment onto the world to wipe out the rebellious military forces and put the revolt down.</Description>

Alternately translated from a variety of local dialects as �Festival of the People� or �Festival of the Pope� (or pontiff), it originated in the Amaris Civil War. In the centuries prior, a pagan ritual known as the Night of the Sword grew to prominence, slowly transforming from a dark ritual observed by a relative few into a veritable celebration of inebriation and excess for the masses, marked by the celebrants carrying blades of all kinds (mostly novelty items, though occasionally actual blades) and making faux sacrifices during the revelry. For years, various Christian churches denounced these pagan and hedonistic celebrations, especially as it began on the evening of Easter Sunday and lasted for two full days. Of course, that only increased its popularity, and on many worlds it soon eclipsed Mardi Gras.&#xD; In the wake of Amaris� bloody revolution on Terra, the nascent New Avalon Catholic Church co-opted the two-day event and began celebrating a festival of life on key worlds throughout the Federated Suns. Since then, it has steadily grown in size and importance, crossing denominational boundaries and becoming the most significant of the Suns� unique religious festivals. Nevertheless, the various religious groups that celebrate it have not been able to eradicate the more secular and still somewhat pagan celebrations of excess. Festa Piepa has become a balanced dichotomy: during the daylight hours, it is an upbeat religious celebration of life and salvation, while at night it is a wild and hedonistic celebration of life and all its secular joys.</Description>

This action fanned the flames of discontent, but no coherent response has surfaced.&#xD; Prefect Cory Andrews was not notified in advance of the raid, nor did he receive official notice from Luthien afterward. Andrews is justifiably nervous, and has made few public appearances or statements since.&#xD; [3050] When the Ghost Bear's 96th Battle Trinary landed in May 3050 at the location agreed to in the batchall, they discovered tat the Regal Death mercenary company had failed to show. Remembering the vanished Black Omen mercenaries on Damien, the 96th went hunting but expected to find no opposition. Bravo Star walked straight into an ambush in the Vernaw Woods, where the mercs had retreated to prepared positions upon detecting the Bears' arrival in-system. Pit traps and minefields destroyed three of Bravo's OmniMechs; concentrated weapons fire took down a forth and seriously damaged the fifth. Fortunately for the lone Ghost Bear survivor, the other two stars of the 96th arrived in time  to make short work of the mercenaries.&#xD; The Bears fought with such ferocity that no Regal Death soldiers survived the assault. After this engagement, many Ghost Bear commanders declared all mercenary units dezgra, unworthy of honorable treatment and fit only for immediate destruction. Upon encountering mercenaries after the battle for Susquehanna, Ghost Bear leaders rarely bothered issuing a batchall and almost never claimed bondsmen from mercenary ranks.</Description>

    <Description>When Shiro Kurita invaded Sverdlovsk in December 2303, he launched the first full-scale interstellar military operation ever seen in the Inner Sphere. The military operation required his entire KF-drive fleet and the vast majority of his battle-ready ground forces. Some reports indicate that only school-age military cadets and retirees were left behind to police New Samarkand and Galedon V. &#xD; Even so, Urizen Kurita's army was not large, either by Terran standards or when compared to armies of two centuries later. Most accounts agree that roughly four divisions, perhaps 50,000 officers and men, landed in the cities and towns of Sverdlovsk.&#xD; Of course, Sverdlovsk had no organized militia, which Kurita knew full well. Moreover, its leaders never expected to face an interstellar invasion, and so were completely staggered by the presence of nervous, but grim-faced soldiers on their peaceful world. Within weeks, the planetary officials (who could barely control their panic) had shakily signed a treaty of complete cooperation. Sverdlovsk became the first conquest of the nascent Draconis Combine.&#xD; One battalion of heavy armor, supported by a regiment of infantry, served as Shiro's personal guard during the invasion of Sverdlovsk. From this small beginning, the Fifth Galedon Regulars were formed. When the Draconis Combine was formally established in 2319, Shiro Kurita resurrected the Fifth and gave them an official place of honor on the rolls of the DCMS.</Description>

    <Description>A water-rich world with a host of natural resources, Syrma was a dream world for colonial developers when it was first discovered during mankind's early exploration of deep space. Ironically enough, the first settlers to set foot on this world would not be industrialists or commercial entrepreneurs, but pilgrims from various anti-technology cultures and religious beliefs. Including representatives from Amish, Native American, and African cultures, these pilgrims established several agricultural communes throughout the arable interiors of Ezera, Lothair, Quan, and Rashida - Syrma's four main landmasses.&#xD; In the wake of the Terran Alliance's fall, these colonists suddenly found themselves cut off from contact with Terra, but their industrious nature made it possible for them to survive as an independent world for a time. The rise of the seemingly aggressive Terran Hegemony, however, soon prompted the community leaders of Syrma to seek outside help in maintaining their independence, and so they sought aid from the nearby Federation of Skye. When Hegemony ships arrived over Syrma, mines and "smart" missiles, planted at the jump points by the Federation, smashed much of the Hegemony fleet.&#xD; The Syrma Disaster, as the Hegemony citizens called it, cast into question the viability of the McKenna family as a ruling line, and inevitably led to the foundation of the Cameron dynasty. As for Syrma, its alliance with Skye led to the opening of the world to increasingly modernized industries, though the anti-technology sects retained their own sizeable enclaves. By the Star League era, this planet had become a jointly administered border world between the Lyran Commonwealth and the Terran Hegemony, with a curious mix of primitive and technocratic lifestyles. Because of the ample resources here, Amaris' troops landed hard on Syrma, executing much of the government - Lyran and Hegemony alike - after brutally seizing control. &#xD; Their efforts to enslave the anti-technology sects as laborers for the mines and factories ultimately led to some of the greatest atrocities of the Amaris Crisis. Syrma would not be freed until Kerensky's return years later. After the fall of the League, the Lyran government claimed Syrma and invested heavily in the reconstruction of its industrial infrastructure, but largely overlooked the descendants of the planet's original settlers and their agro-communes. This trend, continued over the centuries of warfare, eventually led to the near extinction of these simpler communes. Even today, the few remaining settlements left over from the original pilgrims are little more than tourist attractions in Syrma's outback; a mere handful of surviving communities from a bygone era.&#xD; Syrma's capital, Skopje, is located on Lothair's southern reaches, and is home to the planet's largest spaceport-two others may be found in the cities of Scottsdale and Strausborg, on Ezera and Rashida, respectively - as well as the headquarters of DePaik Resource Solutions, a mining and refining company owned by the planet's ruling family.</Description>

The government employs most of the planet's population to run the prefecture bureaucracy, but a sizable number hunt in the planet's many forests for whitetail deer, the menace of Tabayama.&#xD; Imported several hundred years ago by a wealthy industrialist, who loved the seemingly harmless creatures, the deer were soon breeding far too fast for him to control. Through the decades, countless efforts to control the deer have failed.  Currently, the planet employs over two million hunters to shoot the deer, and this number is barely enough to keep the animals from overrunning the planet's croplands. However, Tabayama has a successful industry that exports venison to other worlds.&#xD; The planet's hunters have banded together to form The Hunters' International Collective in an effort to win higher wages. Recent ISF reports indicate that they have no anti-government learning, however.&#xD; [3067] The two million-strong Hunters International collective on Tabayama have since pressed the Koi Transport WiGE into service in their continuing struggle against the whitetail deer, in defense of Tabayama�s precious cropland. The Koi has proven a boon to the Collective, allowing them to shift men and equipment rapidly and ship their kills back for processing and export.</Description>

Accompanying the convoy were four hundred volunteer aid and medical personnel led by Kuan Yin Allard-Liao.&#xD; While distributing aid on Taga, a Death Commando strike team, arriving via pirate point, attacked this convoy. Fortunately, Hydra Squadron was on the far side of the planet at the time. As the enemy DropShips burned in, Rear Admiral Harwood ordered the convoy�s freighters to ground on the planet, while his own vessels matched their orbit.

    <Description>During the Davion Civil War in 2525, Marshal Nikolai Rostov took sides with Alexander Davion against the forces of David and Cassandra Varney. Rostov's idol was the Russian General Kutuzov, who defeated Napoleon during the latter's invasion of Russia. Using a variant of the famous General George Washington's principle of strategic retreat to prevent a less mobile army from establishing effective supply lines, Kutuzov pioneered a policy known as "scorched earth," which called for retreat into the vast Asian continent while destroying everything of value. &#xD; Rostov's favorite strategy was another variant on Washington's and Kutuzov's strategies. Named after a practice popular with dishonest merchants, the bait and switch tactic also relied on strategic retreat into vast wilderness lands to throw an opponent off balance. The object was to lay a trap for an enemy bent on easy plunder.&#xD; On the planet Talcott, for instance, Rostov pretended to flee superior Varnayist forces from nearby Salem. When the pursuers jumped into the Talcott system, they discovered that the defending forces had disappeared into the verdant farmlands of the planet. They foraged the land to replenish their food stocks and notified General Varnay that Rostov's forces had disappeared.&#xD; Varnay wired back, as Rostov knew he would, that Rostov's forces were too significant to be overlooked, and ordered a thorough search of the planet. Rostov's strategy became a waiting game. Rostov was taking a huge gamble. Knowing that his forces would be planetbound for some time, he turned off his heat-generating equipment, whose traces would have led Varnay's troops straight to him. He knew the time had come to move when he intercepted an enemy message that Varnay himself was coming to lead the search. While the enemy was preoccupied with preparations for the arrival of their commanding general, &#xD; Rostov mobilized his troops for a lightning raid on the Varnayist camp. With the element of surprise on their side and with Varnay's troops exhausted from searching, Rostov's troops easily over-powered the Varnayists, crippling their forces and destroying their newly acquired stores of provisions. Then they disappeared back into the wilderness. Varnay arrived to find his troops decimated and that Rostov had simply vanished from the face of the planet.</Description>

Its students learned how to design everything from personal hygiene devices to JumpShips. There were close ties between this college and Hegemony Research and Development Centers. The Amaris forces were quick to search through its records and secret projects. They left little behind. Today the college stands abandoned.&#xD; [3067] Founded by FWLM MechWarrior Angus Gilmour in 3023, Gilmour MilTech began as a maintenance contractor for Talitha�s planetary militia, but soon expanded into custom rebuilding and equipment reconditioning, mainly to support mercenary concerns. The company weathered the storms of the FedCom occupation and became a major supplier to the AFFC as well as maintaining links to the FWLM via what were officially mercenary contracts. &#xD; Returned to League sovereignty after Operation Guerrero, Gilmour built up strategic partnerships with a number of companies, including Hollings-Dupre, Ltd. Subsequently, the company began to manufacture new designs, including the CNS-5M Cronus, an upgrade of the older home-grown CNS-3M model that originally emerged from Gilmour�s lines during the Fourth Succession War. The company has yet to diversify further � most of its resources remain committed to maintenance contracts and rebuilding battlefield wreckage � but Angus Gilmour has stated his intent to release a new BattleMech design, possibly as soon as next year.</Description>

    <Description>Tall Trees is an aptly named forest world. It is a sparsely inhabited, temperate planet with five continents. Lacking enough of an axial tilt to create seasonal variations, most of Tall Trees' land area is covered by deep woods which stretch from sea to sea and nearly from pole to pole. The heavily forested, mountainous terrain of the world has discouraged development, and the planet's population rely primarily on mining, subsistence farming, livestock herding and hunting to provide the necessities of life. Most of the planet's population live in isolated communities. The two major cities of Fa Shura and Helena are located on the continent of Burgundy.&#xD; Possessing a surface gravity of only .78 G, Tall Trees is notable for the unusual native trees known as Xenosequoias. Some specimens of these forest giants have been measured to over a kilometer in height, with diameters of over 60 meters. The high-level forest canopy in areas populated by Xenosequoias blocks out most of the sunlight before it reaches the ground, and surface vegetation is sparse or non-existent. Most other forest areas on Tall Trees pass enough sunlight for a rich diversity of surface vegetation to flourish.&#xD; A secret capellan genetic research installation that is believed responsible for the sudden plague that wiped out the entire island of New Tierra del Fuego II in 2966.  Though only a small percentage of the people here are old enough to remember the plague days, it still galls the natives that Tall Trees is the only planet ever to have reached one billion population only to fall below that number again.&#xD; Despite the fact that 60 years have passed since the New Tierra del Fuego II accident, Capellan troops stationed as guards at the research facility sill receive three times the pay as for normal hazardous duty/combat. The research installation is also believed to be the source of the miraculous food development projects that prevented the famines that had been demographically projected in the late 30th century.&#xD; [3029] Tall Trees fell to the Federated Suns in the Forth Succession War. Spurred by rumors of the research facility, Tall Trees was perhaps House Davions�s most important objective world of the 4th wave. As the first Davion forces were crossing the narrow Straits of New Tierra del Fuego, they saw a series of explosions within the island�s forest. The leader of the Davion forces, Major Richards, and his infantry battalion proceeded to the island. They came upon the smoking rubble of the research facility, and the bodies of three members of the Death Commandoes. The first deaths among Major Richard�s battalion came within hours of the explosions. Soldiers reported feeling nauseous, then fell into comas. Death usually followed the first symptoms within ten minutes. In a hour, most of the battalion was dead.</Description>

    <Description>This planet has been the capital of the Tamar Pact ever since it was discovered and surveyed by the Tamar brothers in 2331. It is a large world whose heavy gravity taxes the system of anyone not native to the planet. Natives of Tamar tend to be either stoutly built or tall and wiry. The effects of the sun and lack of an intervening ozone layer in Tamar's atmosphere gives residents the characteristic deep red complexion known as the "Tamar blush". &#xD; This planet was quite rich in natural resources when first settled. Centuries of mining emptied most of the easily reached layers, leaving the remained deeply hidden and needing special technology help to uncover. To prevent a   depression, Tamar diversified, developing a large trade industry, with major spaceports and facilities for import and export of raw materials and goods.&#xD; Tamar has yet to repair or replace its recharging stations crippled at the close of the last century. Because of this, the Jump Points are prone to be crowded. Most merchants resent this because House Kurita makes frequent raids against Tamar and they will shoot at anything in their way.&#xD; The Sahara continent of Tamar, is an arid, barren wasteland.&#xD; [3025] Only recently re-opened, the War Academy of Tamar will not graduate its first class of officers until 3028. The original school, another former Star League facility, was brutally razed when House Kurita attacked Tamar in 2915. Most of the students and teachers were killed during the valiant defence of their planet. When the Steiner army finally pushed the Kurita invaders out of Tamar 3 years later, the reconstruction effort of the War College was postponed, in the effort to reconstruct the planet. It was only after Tamar historians brought pressure that reconstruction of the academy began in 3017. Currently, the academy only has facilities for training MechWarriors and ground combat officers.  &#xD; One of the other famous arts colleges throughout the Commonwealth, Tamar is home to the Newbury School of Performing Arts.</Description>

They can forgive the eccentricities of rulership, but not when the Tamarind economy lies in a shambles because of the war. When confronted with this by emissaries from Atreus, Otho replied imperiously that falconry signifies a majesty of spirit and is an excellent way to relax, and that they people of Tamarind would not be going hungry if they paid more attention to their own business and less to his. This attitude has made Otho the most unpopular leader in the Free Worlds. He stands little chance of re-election as Prime Minister and may even provoke armed insurrection before the next election.The average citizen lives by the old Terran adage, "When you ain't got nothin', you ain't got nothin' to lose." Until a more effective way to end the unrest on Tamarind is found, Janos Marik will deal with the situation in the same way as his predecessors; by posting three times the usual number of SAFE agents on the planet.&#xD; Tamarind's artists and craftsmen are legendary. Although conventional industries, such as textiles, machinery manufacture, and food exportation, have been torn apart by the war, talented artists are capable of commanding high prices from the prosperous worlds in the Duchy. This has contributed to an ever-increasing gulf between the haves and have-nots on Tamarind, where many artists stay only for the extra money they can charge by being Tamarind artists. It galls the natives to be unable to afford the beautiful works of their natives artists, especially when the artist is someone from the old neighborhood.&#xD; The planet Tamarind is a scarred, desolate place that once was beautiful. Too many BattleMech engagements have killed off much of the local fauna, repeated bombings have left trenches where once were fields and farms, and the forests have been burnt down to prevent the enemy from using them for cover.</Description>

    <HasFactory>true</HasFactory>
    <Description>Through a fluke of bookkeeping, Tancredi IV was not colonized until the late 2570s. Decades earlier, a Terran Alliance scout ship had made a favorable report after visiting this world, but the report became lost somehow. An historian accidentally unearthed it while going through some musty data files in New Avalon one day. How it was possible that no one learned of the planet's existence until then is mystifying.  When the first colonists began to settle Jaipur, they discovered that the original Scout ship report had been far too conservative. Not only did the planet have enough pure water to support a large population, but there was plenty of arable land to support food crops. What most surprised the colonists were the riches lying beneath the soil. The discovery of huge metal deposits meant that this planet could quickly become one of the realms industrial giants. Within 20 years, Taricredi IV had become a major manufacturing force in the region and was daily attracting new companies onworid through an aggressive public relations campaign. Despite being the site of a major battle during the Civil Wars of the Federated Suns, Tancredi IV did not cease its economic expansion.  The Succession Wars stopped all that. When the Star League collapsed, the industrial might of Tancredi was among the first targets of the war, even though the distance to the planet made it difficult for the DCMS forces to make the voyage. Most of Tancredi's industries became casualties of the First War. The military commanders of the Second and Third Wars have avoided damaging the remaining factories, but that has meant using farm and ranchlands for their battles.  Early in the Third Succession War, the Draconis Combine seized Tancredi. For ten years, the world was under the wing of the Dragon, which caused more suffering to the population then to their industries. When the Kuritans began to export most of Tancredi's food crops to feed its own military, it created several major famines. After Davion forces liberated Tancredi in 3023, Hanse Davion approved a massive reconstruction effort to bring the planet back to its former industrial capacity. Because the war has done so much damage to the world's agricultural areas, Tancredi is still in danger of famine.  The capital of Tancredi IV is Dolsonville. &#xD; The Precision Weaponry plant on Tancredi IV is a perfect example of the lengths to which the Successor States will go to protect their diminishing industries. The factories here have been heavily damaged three times; first by the Draconis Combine during the First Succession War, then by Periphery pirates while the  Federated Suns were occupied by the War of 3039, and finally by Fuchida's Fusiliers, when that unit broke its contract rather than face the Clans. The forth time around, the Tancredi engineers hit upon a clever plan. Instead of rebuilding the factories, they hollowed out underground complexes and relocated the facilities. Then they rebuilt the original buildings as empty shells.&#xD;Now the workers enter the plant through the empty "factory" above ground, where the 'Mechs stand guard over an elaborate decoy.</Description>

However, the Truce of Tukayyid forestalled the Jaguar attack, and the Combine troops assumed the Clans would rest and regroup from their losses. Thus, the Third Jaguar Cavaliers' strike against Tanh Linh only two weeks after Tukayyid came as a nasty shock.&#xD; The Second An Ting Legion played a game of feint-and-strike against the Third Cavaliers, relying on its proficient night-fighting tactics to carry the bulk of the resistance. The Clan forces repeatedly tried to bring their full weight to bear against the DCMS units, but it took the better part of a week before the Smoke Jaguars caught the 42nd Dieron against a mountain range. The Clan attackers shattered two battalions before the Second An Ting could come to their rescue. Striking from the rear, the Second hammered the Smoke Jaguars against the same mountain range and the anvil created by the remnants of the Regulars. &#xD; Though taking heavy losses themselves, the Legion members crippled the Cavaliers and knocked acting commander Star Captain Oleg Nevversan out of the fight.

They recalled their aerospace forces and allowed the SLDF ships to land unmolested. The Dragoons chose the Kyrchek Mountains as the place of the battle. Unfortunately, the Dragoons did not comprehend the size of the force arrayed against them, and so their chosen site proved disastrous. As the Seventh moved toward a network of canyons, the SLDF regiments cut them off and decimated them. The battle, and with it the first wave of Operation Bulldog, ended after just five days.</Description>

    <Description>Settled in 2253, Taurus was named after Samantha Calderon's second husband, Victor Taurens, who had perished during the initial penetration of the Hyades Cluster. Taurus quickly proved to be rich in natural resources, including a soil that quickly adapted to the introduction of Terran crops. &#xD; Taurus itself is surrounded by a thick natural barrier of asteroids, seeded with mines and laser cannon emplacements, and host to elements of the Taurian Guard, the elite battalion of the Taurian Defense Force. Taurus is also home to a variety of industries, many of which produce 'Mechs and spare parts. As the nexus of the Concordat social system, Taurus is one of the few cultural centers in the Periphery and presently supports a population of over 2 billion inhabitants.&#xD; [3025] Alone of all the Periphery states, the Taurian Concordat maintains large military training academies. At present, there is one academy for each major combat branch: the Army, Navy, and AeroSpace Arms. The army training academy is the �cole Militaire, located on Taurus. The Taurian Naval Institute and the Concordat AeroSpace Flight School are located on New Vandenberg and Samantha, respectively. Each has a well-developed training program for both NCOs and officers and can accommodate upward of five hundred personnel.&lt;P/&gt;&#xD; The Concordat has also retained the highest literacy rate in the Periphery. Indeed, the Taurian educational system has served as a model for other states, including those of the Inner Sphere. Despite losing many educational institutions during the Reunification War, the Taurians have rebuilt their schools to pre-Star League levels, since regaining their independence. They can now boast no fewer than six universities. Located on Taurus, Samantha, Pinard, New Vandenberg, MacLeod's Land, and Euschelus, these universities graduate an average of over forty thousand students annually.</Description>

    <Description>[2583] Embarrassed and irritated that the Outworlders were ruining his reputation, General Forlough started to implement his scorched-earth policy that would later so devastate the Taurian Concordat. One planet after another went up in smoke at the hands of his Regulars, and the scenes enacted on Cerberus were repeated on a dozen Alliance worlds in the spring and summer of 2583. On every occasion, the Alliance army arrived on the scene only after the destruction had been carried out. Forlough never stayed long enough to present an inviting target to his enemies.&#xD; In the autumn of 2583, the Outworlders staged their showdown with Forlough's "Baby Killers." Acting on intelligence provided by a Star League deserter, the Alliance army, backed by Pitcairn's entire legion, slipped ahead of Forlough's advance scouts and deployed in ambush on the arctic mining world of Tellman IV. Waiting until the Second and Third Divisions of Forlough's 5th Corps had disembarked and were constructing permanent quarters, the infantry and 'Mechs of the Outworlds army attacked in full force, with cries of "Cerberus Lives" on the lips of every warrior.&#xD; With single-minded fury, the attackers drove in on the 5th Corps headquarters, destroying vital command and communications links in the opening moments of the attack. Though Forlough escaped in the melee, he had lost control of the battle, which turned into a massive free-for-all. Supporting fire from DropShips only added to the confusion, as opportunity fire hit friendly positions as often as not. The battle continued until nightfall, when the Alliance forces took advantage of the opportunity to withdraw. Over two hundred Star League 'Mechs were lost in the single Day of Vengeance, and Alliance losses were about half that number.</Description>

    <Description>Cursed with a weak ozone layer that lets in more than the average amount of solar radiation, Telos IV is a warm, dreary world of continual rainstorms and freak tornadoes that ravage all four of its island continents in the middle latitudes. Surviving despite these hazards, the people of this world have developed a reputation for being stubborn and fiercely independent, a reputation that has caused them no small share of problems over the centuries when dealing with the greater realms. &#xD; Shiro Kurita, founder of the Draconis Combine, manipulated the people of Telos IV into joining his growing state through guile and political trickery. When the deceit was discovered, the Telosians revolted, which prompted the first Coordinator to invade the planet as a demonstration of the Combine's superiority. In the years that followed, the population remained stubborn. Though suppressed for a time, the Kuritas found the Telosians difficult to deal with, as they resorted to passive resistance instead of outright rebellion.&#xD; Since Telos IV lacked significant mineral or agricultural wealth, the Combine willingly ceded the world to the rising Terran Hegemony, hoping its dissident population would give the Camerons as much trouble as it had the Kuritas. At first, the Telosians did just that, but Hegemony efforts to improve relations with the planet, which included placing several storm inhibitors (similar to those employed on Bryant) in Telos IV's orbit, helped win over the locals. This amicable relationship helped during the Amaris Crisis, when the Usurper, finding little of value on Telos IV, abandoned the world after demolishing the storm inhibitors and planetary defense network. &#xD; Kerensky's forces found support on Telos IV when they arrived and easily advanced on their campaign of liberation. Returned to Kurita rule after the fall of the League, the Telosians resumed their attitude of passive resistance, which prevented the Dragon from exploiting the planet's modest resources to the fullest, even centuries later. However, this attitude underwent marked improvement after the reforms enacted by Coordinator Theodore Kurita.&#xD; The capital of Telos IV, Triumph, is located on the large northern continent of Dulles. Telos IV's other three continents - Rustov on the equator and Fellin and Haranshire in the southern hemisphere - are home to a scattering of large cities and mining towns.</Description>

Tematagi in the Free Worlds League was the company�s home, however, a corporate world reminiscent of Irian or Keystone. The Draconis Combine was Nimakachi�s largest �foreign� market, and in 2602 Nimakachi purchased the bankrupt Sendai mining complex in the city of Mulifanua on Lapida II, transforming the subterranean complex into a self-contained manufacturing enclave. &#xD; Nimakachi-Lapida soon prospered. Nicknamed �Tematagi Minor� by many in the workforce, it earned contracts from the DCMS and the SLDF. Today, the twin factories of Lapida and Tematagi remain intertwined with the two militaries, aided by the loose provisions of the Concord of Kapteyn. The Lapida/Tematagi Minor plant produces �Mechs under contract to the DCMS (the signature Spider as well as the Venom and Bishamon), while the original Tematagi plant produces designs for the FWLM (notably the Vulcan and the Spider).&#xD; Nimakachi is also deeply enmeshed in DropShip manufacture, producing the Octopus tug and Condor troop transport at its Dalton plant. Third-party corporations produce many of the components used in this process, but the orbiting yards build the spaceframes and interplanetary drives as well as carrying out final assembly. Demand for both models remains high, with the League government the largest purchaser. A civilian version of the Condor, the cargo-carrying Stork-class, is undergoing pre-delivery trials in advance of full-scale production scheduled to commence in 3069.</Description>

The Third and Eleventh Pesht Regulars awaited them on the Brodice Plain, a large, flat grassy stretch of land offering precious few places to conceal traps. The 449th and 489th Assault Clusters engaged their targets immediately on landing and quickly proved that the Pesht Regulars had sacrificed all advantages of their previous combat experience by trying to match the Clan fighting style. The Nova Cats were systematically wiping out the Third and eleventh 'Mech by 'Mech until Hohiro Kurita, heir to the Combine throne, assumed command of the combined regiments.&#xD; Hohiro ordered the Regulars to break away from the battle, and he coordinated a guerrilla campaign instead, eventually sending the remaining troops to ground. The Nova Cats' enemy vanished before their eyes, and they suddenly found themselves bogged down in an apparently fruitless effort to find the Kuritans. The Third and Eleventh helped organize a resistance movement on Teniente and then supported its efforts for several long months. At the request of Hohiro's sister Omi, the Revenants, a Federated Commonwealth unit commanded by Prince Victor Steiner-Davion, eventually executed a daring raid against the Nova-cat controlled planet and spirited Hohiro Kurita and what remained of the Third and Eleventh off Teniente.&#xD; [3059] When the Izanagi Warriors descended on Teniente during the first wave of Operation Bulldog, they found the Nova Cats Sixth Garrison Cluster waiting for them. Having heard the stories sung in the Clan Remembrance of the exploits Tai-sa Shin Yodama, Galaxy Commander Carl Lenardon and the entire Sixth Garrison Cluster, considered it a high honor to accept defeat at the elite of the DCMS regiment's hands.</Description>

    <Description>Terra was, without doubt, the most beautiful planet in the universe when the Star League was in full flower. By the 26th century, technology had eliminated pollution. This coupled with the exodus of more than three-forths of the planet's population over the years, allowed Terra to regain some of her natural beauty. Forests grew back over abandoned farms, streams and rivers washed themselves clean, and the air became sweet again.&#xD; Because so many people left Terra for the colonies, many cities were abandoned and were eventually reclaimed by Mother Nature. The cities that remained, usually ones with great historical significance, were restored and improved to take advantage of modern transportation and sanitation. Heavy industries were confined to parks outside the cities.&#xD; During the years of the Star League, there were two capitals on Terra. The capital of planetary and Hegemony politics was Geneva, on the continent of Europe. It had little industrial importance but was the center of the Hegemony bureaucracy, with more than 100 government buildings. The seizure of Terra by troops of Stefan Amaris in 2766 caused extensive damage to the city, especially to the government buildings of their precious records. Today it is the location of Earth University, a major liberal arts college.&#xD; The war to liberate Terra from Stefan Amaris did not damage the planet as extensively as it did some Hegemony worlds. Every crater, every crushed city, every defacing of a Terran landmark seemed twice as upsetting because it was a wound against the Cradle of Humanity. All five continents were touched in some way by the Amaris occupation or the fight to liberate the planet. North America suffered the most damage, especially around the capital of the Star League. The Court of the Star League, once called "the brightest jewel worn by Mother Earth," was turned into a city of ghosts by the coup. The initial fighting caused considerable damage to the city. Once there, the conquerors became more systematic in their destruction. Buildings were demolished on a whim, or left to stand, only to be desecrated in some foul way.&#xD; After its liberation in 2780, the city could still support thousands, but those who had fled did not return. The few who had been in the city during the Amaris occupation left soon after the shooting was over. They said that too many every things had happened in the city, that the city had to be haunted. It is easy to see why they thought this. The buildings' soaring architecture contrasts uneasily with the horrors that went on inside them. Now, only the curious, criminals looking for sanctuary, and ComStar's archaeologists willingly venture into the Court of the Star League. Over the years, the removal of artifacts from the city has produced many discoveries. Soon the city will be left empty.&#xD; Other places of major importance are the 20 HRAD (Hegemony Research and Development) facilities scattered across the planet, the 10 known HMSL (Hegemony Military Science Labs), the 20 Castles Brian, and the 500 SLDF bases.</Description>

    <Description>Blessed with huge tracts of untamed forests, extensive mineral resources, and mountainous reaches, Terra Firma, in many ways, was considered a twin to the nearby Capolla. Colonized jointly with Capolla by a collection of small corporations and independent homesteaders, trade between both worlds led to a prosperous and semi-symbiotic relationship even before the formation of the Terran Hegemony and the Star League. &#xD; This relationship worked so well that both worlds supported a strong and diverse economic and social base without the need for major military industries. In a deal brokered at the twin system's entry into the Hegemony, Terra agreed to a limited autonomy for both worlds - a policy that every successive power after the Hegemony assumed as well.&#xD; In the chaos that erupted following the collapse of the Federated Commonwealth, much of Terra Firma's landscape and many cities were damaged by heavy fighting. The formation of the Terracap Confederation with Capolla helped Terra Firma to recover, but aid from the Word of Blake, in exchange for the right to place military bases and "defensive forces" on the planet, truly brought the planet's ravaged infrastructure back from the brink. Pledging a continued hands - off policy in the tiny alliance's political and business affairs, and their troops to the defense of both worlds, the Blakists earned the support - and, in some cases, fear - of the Terra Firma population. &#xD; Terra Firma has two main continents - Rusalaia the primary continent, and Reniki, the smaller, equatorial continent to the east. The capital city, Aserlitz, home to the planet's single spaceport, is located on Rusalaia's northern coast. On Reniki, Ballard-Dukempic Foods of Keid maintains a branch office in the city of Nystoll. A recovering industry with a history dating back to the glory days of the Star League, the foodstuffs super-corporation now oversees most of the farming and ranching industries that are once more on the rise in Reniki's open plains.</Description>

    <Description>Tharkard was discovered in 2310 by an explorer group from nearby Donegal. Though the rugged mountains and windy, arctic climate extending over most of its surface made it seem a dreary place for humans, the world also contained major radioactive and gem deposits. When Seth Marsden visited Tharkad in 2311, he found the cold, peaceful solitude to be breathtaking. So taken was he with the long nights and their spectacular aurora borealis that Marsden managed eventually to control and claim it as his own. He then began a program of massive importation of cold weather plants and animals from Terra and other worlds to spread across his new home.&#xD; He had soon created a world with large pine forests populated with deer, caribou, wolves, Skye boars, and Tharkan gazelle. In many ways, Tharkad is like the arctic wilderness of Terra, except that its arctic regions extend all the way down to the 30th latitude of the planet. There are five major continents and three major island chains on Tharkad. Tharkad City, the capital, is located on Bremen, the largest continent.&#xD; When Tharkad became the capital of the Lyran Commonwealth in 2407, space was cleared in the middle of a large forest ten kilometers to the north of Olympia for construction of the Capital city. The large and somberly elegant Royal Palace, Government House, and Royal Court form the three cusps of the Triad, a triangular complex of buildings all devoted to the administration of the Commonwealth. Today, the Triad includes over 300 buildings of all types and styles, whose purposes range from hospitals and houses of worship to apartments for nobles and Representatives from distant worlds and a botanical garden. It is a common saying that there is a building for every populated world in the Commonwealth somewhere in the Triad.&#xD; Even the fusion reactor operating deep beneath this modern city to generate power and heat cannot hold back the Tharkan cold. At the first sign of winter snowfall, the people, both rich and poor, begin unpacking clothing designed for the coming Tharkan blizzards and bone-chilling cold. Attending the Royal Court during a Tharkan winter is an unusual experience for those used to visiting courts in warmer climes. The Commonwealth nobility likes to dress in furs during the winter months, more out of necessity than vanity. Women wear long, fur-trimmed gowns, while the men wear fur hats and fur coats crisscrossed with chains of jewelry and precious metals. As people speak in the large and high-ceilinged Throne Room, their breaths sometimes rise in wisps of condensation to create a thin layer of shiny ice on the armor of the two Griffin BattleMechs guarding the Archon.&#xD; Set on the crest of nearby Mount Wotan is Asgard, the military headquarters of the Steiner armed forces. It is a fortress with one major tower flanked by four smaller ones. All five towers are heavily armed; below them are hangers for a regiment of 'Mechs, two infantry and tanks, and a Wing of AeroSpace Fighters. Built some 200 feet beneath the base of the mountain, is the headquarters of the Lyran Intelligence Corps. The LIC directs all operations from this hardened bunker, assigning agents to missions and monitoring the current political and military situation throughout the Inner Sphere. The walls of the bunker are two meters thick and reinforced by a charged-steel mesh. In addition to protecting the occupants and equipment against bombardment, the walls also absorb EMP should an attacker resort to nuclear weapons. &#xD; There are no roads leading to the Triad, and so all traffic must enter by VTOL craft or by one of the three separate subway systems that link the Triad with Olympia to the south, Asgard to the west, and the rest of Tharkad City five miles to the north.&#xD; During the Good Years, the planet underwent a boom in mining and steel manufacture. The Star League also established a military base with major storage facilities on the tropical Tatyana Islands during this era. With the fall of Star League, Tharkad's industries were plunged for a time into deep economic depression. With the need to produce weapons and other military equipment for the Succession Wars, Tharkad's industries revived.&#xD; Tharkad is also home to the Nagelring, the oldest and most prestigious military academy in the Commonwealth. Named after a sword used by an ancient German folk-hero, the academy was originally an official Star League academy. When the Steiner house forces took over after the Star League personnel left the Inner Sphere, they were surprised to find that many of the professors and instructors had decided to stay on.&#xD; The Nagelring soon began producing trained officers in all fields for the Commonwealth military. a sprawling university on Tharkad's Bremen continent, the academy has an extensive variety of training aids such as Chameleon training 'Mechs and two-seat Jenny Aerospace fighters. The academy also trains DropShip and JumpShip crews.&#xD; Located in Olympia, Tharkad University specializes in history. Though history may not seem of the same importance as scientific research, its study is crucial because 90% of the scientific knowledge now being 'discovered' was originally known for hundreds of years before the Succession Wars erased it from human memory. Katherine Steiner, the first Steiner Archon, was an alumna of Tharkad University and her government continues the policy of heavily funding it.&#xD; Most widely known of all the various arts colleges throughout the Commonwealth, is the Rewland college of Fine Arts on Tharkad.

    <Description>Home base of "King" Hopper Morrison and his Extractors, The Rack and the nearby planet of Pain are small ugly worlds, a combination of slum and pirate Kingdom rolled together. One of Morrison's raiding parties ended up on The Rack and were foraging for anything of value when they stumbled across a buried Star League bunker complete with mothballed BattleMechs. Morrison has since used these Mechs to build his little army into a serious threat. Over the years, the Extractor's have taken thousands of slaves to run a digging operation to dredge off the side of a mountain to see if there is any more Star League tech stored there. Even then, the most believable estimates can only narrow down the combined population of Pain and The Rack to between fifteen and twenty thousand, half of which are slaves.&#xD; The world itself has an extremely jagged rock formation, with very few places to even land a DropShip. Obsidian and all sorts of metallic and radioactive ores make up these rocks, and combined with the weather, plays hell with sensors and communications. Back in the days of the Star League there was a weather control system on the planet. Without it, the planet is perpetually covered with rainstorms in some areas, with major thunder and lightning activity. What little light filters through turns the water-laden clouds a sick purple hue.&#xD; [3059] Tired of Morrison's raids, the Rim Collection sent the mercenary unit Able's Ace's, effectively it's standing military force, to rid them of the menace of the "King" Hopper Morrison and his Extractor's. Large numbers of his troops were destroyed, though Morrison himself escaped. The Ace's further weakened his power base by freeing all the slave laborers, and destroying the expensive dredging and pumping equipment.</Description>

    <Description>Thorin and the many other planets in close proximity to Terra, were the first planets colonized during latter part of the 23rd century, known as the Exodus period. Even horror stories, like that of bull-sized predators who devoured the entire colony on Thorin, did not dampen the widespread desire to flee the politics and pollution of Terra.&#xD; The Hegemony library on Thorin was the largest library ever built. Just outside Ecol City, it was constantly expanded until it filled more than 100 buildings clustered around the huge domed Central Library. The proud people of Thorin boasted that it contained a copy of every published book. Though that claim may not be true, the library was a mind-boggling warehouse of information. During the coup, the Second Amaris Dragoons set it on fire. That single act of wanton violence, consuming every building of the Hegemony Library, set mankind back hundreds of years.&#xD; The University of Thorin, one of the "Golden Ten" universities of the Star League, was nestled in the dark forests of Thorin's northern continent. The focus was on economics. The university was severely damaged during the Amaris coup and was later abandoned. The forest has since taken over the deserted campus.&#xD; Ecol City is the capital of Thorin, and is situated on the southern most of the two continents.&#xD; The Dublin Swamps, which run south and west of Ecol City, are notorious for their difficulty of navigation and as the breeding ground of insects of phenomenal size. The equatorial swamps are nearly two hundred kilometers in diameter, with island-like hills that rise from the shadowy mire.&#xD; [3062] Founded in 2832, the Flight Academy of Thorin gained a reputation for producing excellent aerospace pilots and DropShip crews. However, the academy sustained heavy damage during the Succession Wars, limiting its enrolment. The resulting repairs were deemed prohibitively expensive, and so the school limped on without them. As a result, even when the demand for naval crews increased in the '40s and '50s, there was never any likelihood of upgrading the Thorin facility. Instead, the LAAF chose to build a new facility at Alarion and slowly downgrade Thorin. The last class entered the academy in summer 3060 and will graduate in June 3063. At that point, the remaining equipment will relocate to Alarion, as will most of the instructors. Those choosing to retire from the LAAF have been offered employment with Christifori Express, a Thorin-based shipping company.</Description>

Even at the system's jump points, radiation levels are uncomfortably high.&#xD; Thankfully though, this isn't a problem for the inhabitants of Thuban, the system's only inhabited world. Thuban is a manmade world, one of a number of engineered planets scattered across the Inner Sphere, shaped by the engineers of the old Star League. Originally an airless, radiation blasted rock the size of Terra's moon, its core has been hollowed out into a vast rock-enclosed cavern. The planet's spin was increased to provide an artificial out-is-down gravity, and its interior filled with a breathable atmosphere distilled from the native rock and ice. It is an inside out world, an enclosed environment entered through an airlock, a place where you can stand on the ground and look up at farmlands and forest, and small landlocked seas. The 'sun' is a thin, intensely radiant thread across the land-encircled sky, that literally pipes in light from the outside as required. &#xD; [3064] During the FedCom Civil War, Allied forces struck at Thuban as part of the second thrust of Operation Scatter, a diversionary action designed to overload the LAAF's ability to respond. The Twenty-Third Arcturan Guards faced little resistance on Thuban itself, and quickly prepared to move on.&#xD; The Loyalist Eleventh Arcturan Guards arrived at Thuban too late to catch the bulk of the Twenty-Third, but were able to catch a combined arms battalion, left behind to effect repairs. The final battle, on the slopes of Scorpius Mons, was a bloody affair that cost both forces dearly and testified to the fratricidal nature of civil war.</Description>

    <Description>[3050] When Clan Ghost Bear announced its batchall for Thule in March 3050, the defending First Husars of the Rasalhague Kungs�rme refused to respond. Though she had no idea what a Galaxy represented, �verste Joannie Swigard massed her troops in the Fresdon Desert, a treacherous terrain for which her troops had been selectively trained, and prepared to do battle. &#xD; A force of three Trinaries dropped onto the desert plain anticipating a swift victory, but the Clan force failed to take account for the incredible heat of Thule's noonday sun. Many Clan 'Mechs shut down after their first volleys, leaving them vulnerable to the Hussar's artillery. Before the Bears could restart their machines, they lost a full Trinary of equipment. The First then began a running battle, using their light 'Mechs to draw the Ghost Bear fire, move out of harms way, and then return to attack their overheated opponents.&#xD; Star Colonel Fran�ois Cole broke his bid first, ordering the remainder of his Cluster to approach the Husars from the east. The Husars had anticipated this strategy, and sent aerospace fighters to strafe the Third Bear Striker Cluster on its approach. In response, Star Colonel Stephan Hustig broke his bid and called in his aerospace elements. As the fighters danced overhead, the Fiftieth Striker Cluster (the Black Bears) advanced. The two Clan forces surrounded the First Husars but did not engage the enemy. Suspicious of the sudden calm, the Husars sent out recon units. When these units failed to return, �verste Swigard realized that the Bears had not given up, but were waiting for nightfall.&#xD; Rather than waiting for the Clans to gain the advantage, the Husars decided to push at the Ghost bear lines while the sun was still high in the sky. Using an artillery barrage to cover its movement, the Husars struck at the Bears northern flank. When the Bears attempted to stem the tide by setting their lighter elements against the Husars, �verste Swigard simply maneuvered her troops away from the Bears heavier elements. Meanwhile the Husars infantry continued to tear huge holes in the Ghost Bears rear lines. Star Colonel Paul Vishio broke his bid next by calling in aerospace forces to silence the Husar's long-range guns.&#xD; Deprived of their artillery, the Husars could do little but run. They made for the large river that bisected the Fresdon plain to meet their naval assets. An entire company sacrificed itself in the final push that allowed the Husars to board the massive cargo ships and head upriver. Unwilling to simply sink the cargo ships - a vote amongst the warriors present concluded this went against Clan honor - units were dispatched to follow the ships until they landed. With the majority of the Husars out of the picture, the Ghost Bear Khans declared Thule pacified, and left the 312th Assault Trinary behind to garrison Thule.&#xD; The First Husars finally reappeared two months later and destroyed the 312th, forcing the Ghost Bears to re-pacify the world. The Golden Bears returned to Thule and caught the remainder of the First in the planet's frigid south lands. The Bears easily swept through the Husar's prepared positions, the Elementals taking control of the narrow trenches that the First had intended to use as fortifications. The battle ended almost before it began, and certain proof indicates that Joannie Swigard has already risen to warrior status from bondsman.&#xD; [3063] During the Ghost Bear invasion, the infamous Black Omen mercenaries - jumped at the opportunity to gain some retribution against their old enemies. From Wolcott, the Omen secretly penetrated the Dominion and waged a McCarron�s-style campaign against the worlds of Pinnacle, Holmsbu, and Thule, disabling each planet�s HPG and destroying munitions depots along the way.</Description>

Several dissident political groups took advantage of this discontent to organize a series of demonstrations against the planetary government. Police forces responded with tactics that only made the situation worse. Soon, several regions of the planet were ungovernable and a full-scale revolt was brewing.&#xD; As local troops were unable or unwilling to restore order, the planetary governor called for help from provincial forces. The Regulan High Command responded by sending in four infantry regiments, three armored regiments, and the first and Fifth Regulan Hussars. The rebellion soon began to dissolve under the pressure of these reinforcements.&#xD; Unfortunately, the rebels showed initial success against the newly arrived provincial forces. Though this did not affect the final outcome, it did cause several units to question the wisdom of their leaders. Some units actually defected to the enemy, helping to prolong the struggle by three weeks, prior to being destroyed.&#xD; The capital city of Tiber is Verona.&#xD; One of Tiber's continents is site of the tiny Duchy of New Assam, consisting of  a population of a mere 4 million people.

    <Description>Named in honor of the last premier of the Terran Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the planet Tikonov was one of the first worlds colonized during the first wave of colonial Terran expansion during the early 22nd century. Originally settled by immigrants with strong Eurasian and western Asian background, Tikonov more than any other world in the Confederation has maintained a link (however tenuous) with its Terran heritage. &#xD; Tikonov is a large, mostly arid world that was one of the first settled by Mankind. Its many large mineral deposits quickly made it a center of industry. With industrial power came political power, and by the late 23rd century Tikonov emerged as the political nexus of the region by establishing the first republican union. Existing technologies and vast distances made these original unions temporary at best, but the inhabitants of Tikonov have never forgotten their role as the prime organizers of the first political unification of the Capellan Zone: The Tikonov Grand Union.&#xD; As the capital of the Tikonov Grand Union, Tikonov eventually became a member of the fledgling Capellan Confederation, and then Star League. During the Forth Succession War, Tikonov fell to the Federated Suns. In a deal with Colonel Paval Ridzik, the former leader of the Capellan Armed Forces, The Federated Suns agreed to recognize the Tikonov Free Republic and to terminate all hostile operations within its borders in return for a pact of mutual protection and defense. This deal allowed House Davion to reduce its garrison forces, whilst also denuding the Confederation of more worlds.&#xD; After Ridzik's assassination, the TFR voted to join the nascent Federated Commonwealth in 3031. During the FedCom Civil War, the Free Tikonov Movement resurged on Tikonov, and with the aid of Warrior House Da Da Chi they recaptured their world. Though technically now an independent world, Tikonov is currently garrisoned by CCAF troops and is classified as a Capellan holding.&#xD; Tikonov is a large arid world that has four major landmasses: Ufa in the northeast, Krasnodar in the southeast, Pskov in the southwest, and Kazan in the northwest. Tikograd, the capital of Tikonov, is located on Kazan. The largest, and most heavily industrialized city on the planet, Tikograd has long been divided into three areas: administrative, industrial and residential. Each section is separated from the others by its own walls and towers, with only a limited number of roads and subways connecting the three sections. Surrounding the whole complex is another series of walls and towers, though not as imposing as the inner ones.&#xD; The planet supports three major defense contractors: Earthwerks, Ceres Metals and Harcourt Productions. Tikograd is located northeast of the Ural Mountains, the capital and home to Earthwerks largest plant. Ceres Metals is located on Asano Bay outside the city of New Moscow on the northwest coast of Ufa. Tukwila Valley is a major agricultural center for Tikonov, and is located on the continent of Ufa due south of New Moscow. Harcourt Productions is located in the city of Tukwila.

    <Description>Toffen is a mostly self-sufficient agricultural world. It has three continents, one of which is a small, barren wasteland covered with rocks and sand. The second-largest continent, Jacobitz, is the center of industrial activity, most of which is civilian in nature. Almost all the large cities are there, as well as extensive mining operations. Jacobitz is mountainous and has a rough weather pattern, no matter what the time of year. &#xD; Graham is the largest of the three continents. The southern expanses are on the equator and are hot jungles and deserts. To the north, they give way to vast, rolling plains from the center of the continent to the western shores. The plains flood in the spring and are burned off by the locals during the summer. The eastern side of Graham is heavily forested. It is mountainous, with four major ranges and countless others. The largest city on Graham is Pied, which is only 30,000 strong. The rest of the population is spread throughout numerous farming communities.&#xD; [3052] Clan Ghost Bear landed on Toffen in March 3052. Defending the world were the Third and Eighth Toffen Guards, comprised of 2 'Mech companies and regiment of infantry. The major metropolitan centers of Toffen lay beneath Dell Reservoir. Gambling that the Ghost Bears would not use their aerospace strength in order to avoid damaging the cities they had come to conquer, the Third and Eighth made their initial stand at Dell. Facing the 469th Assault Trinary, the defenders moved forward, confident of victory against a mere fifteen 'Mechs. The Bears, however, had others ideas. They easily routed the green defenders and followed the retreating units to the abandoned Longueil power plant, three kilometers away. &#xD; There, the Guards' infantry elements used the abundant large metal cylinders as excellent cover while they sowed the plant with explosives. While the frustrated Ghost Bears opened every old generator and looked inside for the enemy, the troopers of the Third and Eighth slipped a few at a time out of the building. Scenting an Inner Sphere trap, Star Captain Pinter Hall led the 469th out of the plant just before it detonated. The angry Ghost Bears hunted down the remainder of the defenders, but many of the Guards escaped and went to ground. The planetary garrison is still dealing with occasional flare-ups of violence from the surviving Toffen Guards.&#xD; An old SLDF base is also situated on Graham. By 3062, this had been reactivated by Clan Ghost Bear.</Description>

Among the worlds in and around the Golden Five-the planets New Avalon, Galax, El Dorado, Belladonna and Torrence - it often seems that the glory days of the Star League never left. This is misleading. The Star League did fall and these worlds, though still impressive with their high-tech items and pristine cities, are only just rediscovering and learning to use technology of the 25th century. &#xD; Nevertheless, the Golden Five are worlds where even the lowliest citizen can expect sufficient food and a warm, dry place to sleep. Items like holosystems and remote communication devices are considered essential for the average middle-class family.&#xD; Kiverson City is home to the headquarters of Vinson Pharmaceuticals. Vinson is currently attempting to avoid being nationalized by the Torrence government, which recently went socialist. In its efforts to remain independent, the company has been looking for offworld investors to buy up at least 40 percent of the company's securities, which would make it ineligible for nationalization. Vinson is famed for its ability to isolate the effective agents in old folk remedies such as herbal teas or homeopathic mixtures. Its several powerful, yet cheaply made, painkillers have made the company extremely popular with the Davion military.</Description>

    <Description>[3025] The worlds of the Tortuga Dominions have, it seems, been under the thrall of a pirate leader since they were colonized during the last years of the Reunification War by the Federated Suns' 237th Light Cavalry Regiment. Like many other Periphery worlds, Tortuga Prime and its surrounding systems became the destination for countless refugees of war. The disgruntled descendants of the 237th, degenerated into a tight-knit band of pirates who prey on Taurians and Davions alike.&#xD; A world of vast savannahs and once-abundant raw materials, Tortuga Prime has the dubious distinction of being the center of the Tortuga Dominions. Over the years, Tortuga Prime has been striped of almost all its ore, and is currently nearing ecological exhaustion. An estimated 60 thousand brigands of every description inhabit Raiders Roost, the sole settlement on the planet, though most live in conditions of near destitution. The current ruler of Tortuga Prime is the self-styled Dame Paula Trevaline, as known as "Lady Death" to friend and foe alike.&#xD; [3063] The Pirates of Tortuga plagued humanity for centuries, until the AFFC crushed the Pirates in 3042 and captured Dame Paula Trevaline. Trevaline was sentenced to life imprisonment in New Syrtis's maximum security facility (though reportedly managed to escape in 3063). The Dominion worlds then existed as a collection of subsistence-level planets until 3054, when Fushida's Fusiliers arrived.  &#xD; Believing themselves betrayed by the AFFC, and ordered to the front as a sacrificial offering to the Clan juggernaught, the Fusiliers broke their contract in 3050 and escaped into the Periphery. After trying to establish themselves on Port Krin, they were soundly drubbed in 3051 by the revitalized forces of the Brotherhood of Randis. Eventually, the Fusiliers wound up on Tortuga Prime, where the populace saw them as a means to recover their influence. The Fusiliers closed the borders for better than a year. When they emerged, it was as if the Dominions had suddenly emerged after a twelve-year stupor. Their raids against House Davion, the Taurian Concordat and Outworlds Alliance then resumed with abandon. &#xD; Life in the Tortuga Dominions is surprisingly good. The worlds are able to support each other and they even have a thriving light industry. The Fusiliers have since dropped many of their long-standing traditions and now claim the name of their new home. Though the Tortuga Fusiliers have succumbed to some of the more vile temptations of piracy, they leave the people of the Dominions alone, save for extracting their yearly levies.</Description>

    <Description>Towne is a geologically young planet with large mountains and deep oceans, but also features a diverse ecosphere, the epitome of which is the giant, shaggy, six-legged Eiglotherium. Warmer than Terra, the first colonial settlements were established on the northern Hyborian Continent. Towne was settled in the late 22nd century by an expedition mounted by eccentric trillionaire C. Augustus Pons. One of many eccentricities was his lifelong addiction to archaic fantastic fiction. He was obsessed with the works of the early twentieth century writer Robert Edwin Howard; especially his stories of a barbarian adventurer named Conan. This is why most of the planet's landmasses, continents and towns bear names related to Howard's writings.  &#xD; Lying at the mouth of a river opening into a bay formed by the crater of an eons-old meteorite strike (whose shape guaranteed it would be named Circle Bay, obsession or no obsession), is the capital of Port Howard.&#xD; Abundant metallic ore deposits, with copper the largest by far, are found mostly found in the planet's oceans. These deposits have formed the basis of Towne's industry, as well as a host of offshore mining platforms and underwater communities seeking to access these valuable resources. Hardwoods and cattle ranching are Towne's next most major industries, and for that reason much of the planet's imports have been in the form of industrial 'Mechs, particularly mining, construction, and forestry 'Mech designs.&#xD; As a Combine-Suns border world, Towne has suffered its share of invasions during the Succession Wars, but despite it all, the planet retains much of its natural beauty.&#xD; Aside from the Hyborian continent, Towne has four other landmasses, with Krom atin the south pole, Fetryl and Gherst in the southern temperate lattitudes, and the island-continent of Howell in the north, several hundred kilometers east of Hyboria. Of these landmasses, all but Krom are sparsely populated. Gherst, in fact, features the planet's second-largest city, a water-port town called Kale Bay, second only to the capital city of Port Howard. Located on the Hyborian continent, Port Howard is also home to the Price John Spaceport, Towne's major link to the galaxy at large.</Description>

    <Description>Trell 1, or Trellwan as it is known by its local population, has two small, landlocked equatorial seas with total 9% of the planet's surface. The planet's human colonies have grown in the relatively fertile regions within a few hundred kilometers of these bodies. The high sulfur and Hydrogen Sulfide content of these acid waters make the air for kilometers around heavy with a sour, rotten-egg stench. Much of Trellwan's power comes from unmanned tidal generator plants along the foul-smelling shores of these seas.&#xD; The remaining surface area is divided into rugged mountains and uplands, and vast, arid desert lowlands. Tidal stresses account for the high mountain ranges along the equator, as well as for continuing volcanism and seismic activity.&#xD; A few of the wide variety of native plants and animals adapted to Trellwan's dry, extreme-temperature surface conditions have been catalogued. Various offworld flora and fauna have been introduced at several equatorial locations by human colonies established in approximately 2616.&#xD; Trellwan's ecology is dominated by its short orbital period and relatively long rotational period. The planet has escaped the fate of many inner worlds in close proximiety to their star, and has a rotational period different from its year. However, tidal drag has slowed Trellwan's rotation until the planet is locked in a 2:3 resonance with its primary; its year is only 45 standard days, while its day is 30.5 standard days long.&#xD; The long periods of alternating darkness and light coupled with short and climatically sever seasons, pose a serious challenge both for native life forms and for human colonies located south of the mountains near the Grimheld Sea. &#xD; Twellwan's human population is divided among three cities - Sarghad, Gath, Tremain - plus a scattering of homesteads, agrodome collectives, and mining sites that stretch along about a third of the equator. Of these, Sarghad is the major city, the center of world government and trade, and the site of the world's only spaceport. The planetary government is a monarchy with an appointed, unicameral legislature.</Description>

    <Description>The people of Trellisane have devised a unique political structure. Settled early in the Exodus by disaffected political expatriates seeking a new democracy, Trellisane had a fiercely public-spirited populace for two generations. The descendants of the original settlers, however, soon became as complacent about their democratic rights and privileges as their Terran ancestors had long before. Particularly galling to the leaders was the fact that both voters and voter registration had steadily declined over the years, as more people figured that their vote would make little difference. When voting dropped below 50% of those eligible, the leaders declared a crisis and introduced a surprising solution.&#xD; Because the numbers of voters had become so unwieldy but because voting was the cornerstone of participatory democracy, the leaders declared that everyone eligible to vote would be required to do so by law, but that each adult would be eligible to vote only once in every three elections. Thus, the electorate would be smaller, and everyone would have their chance at voicing their opinion at how the government should be run. Knowing that the next election in which they could vote would be six years away, rather than two, a far higher percentage of people actively campaigned and debated issues. The next plebiscite had the highest voter turnout ever in the history of Trellisane.&#xD; [3067] Most of the League�s aerospace industry centers on ImStar and Andurien AeroTech, but the determination of Daniel Guttierez has won a small but significant niche for his advanced F-94 variant of the Stingray. Though outperformed by more modern variants and new designs like the Shiva, the Guttierez model was the first to feature advanced technology (beating the Andurien variant by four months). Produced in relatively limited quantities, the F-94 has developed a cult following, with its advocates evangelizing Guttierez�s precision-built and hand-finished product. &#xD; FWLM statistics lend credence to these claims, suggesting that the Trellisane model�s survivability is up to twenty percent higher than other variants of the Stingray. In addition to several refinements of the original F-94, Gutierrez Aerospace is working on a new production model of the Lancer technology testbed, as well as a second new model scheduled to debut before 3070. Negotiations with Diverse Optics to license several new laser technologies have caused considerable speculation, but at present no firm specifications of the new model are available.</Description>

    <Description>3067] The city of Bouldertown is home to the Triesting headquarters of TK Industries. Originally known as Triesting-Kelang Weapons Industries, a company-wide reorganization of this major personal firearms producer for the LAAF and Lyran police agencies led to the shortening of the corporate logo to present a fresher look for today's post-Succession Wars market. Founded shortly after the Second Succession War by Rolf Scheddar, a retired LCAF infantry colonel, the company's focus has always been to create reliable, affordable and easily maintained infantry combat weapons. &#xD; Toward this end, many TK lines were designed with universal parts or use the same gauges of ammunition, allowing for ease of repair and maintenance from fewer parts kits � factors that made them an early favorite when the Lyran military shopped around for a reliable producer for its infantry rifles and submachine guns.&#xD; Today, TK Industries is the proud maker of the TK and Gunther assault rifle series. In the aftermath of the company's recent reorganization under Baron Harwin Scheddar, who assumed the helm in 3064, rumors have begun to float that the company is looking into expanding its Kelang factories to produce 'Mech-grade ballistic weaponry, and that Scheddar may soon achieve his publicly stated dream of being the first to unveil a Lyran-made TK rotary autocannon.</Description>

One of the most popular legends in the Lyran Commonwealth concerns the 25th Heavy Assault Regiment. Stationed on Trolloc Prime, then the limit of the Tamar Pact, the unit was the first casualty of the First Succession War. Commanded by Colonel Jerico Marsden, one of the last descendants of Alistar Marsden, the regiment disobeyed an order to retreat and instead made a stand on the high promontory overlooking the capital city. In ferocious battles that lasted five days and nights, the 25th were wiped out, but not before slowing the advance of Lord Kurita's forces long enough to ensure the orderly withdrawal of Commonwealth forces.      &#xD; Since then, many a Commonwealth soldier claims to have encountered the specter of one of the 25th's MechWarriors just before embarking on a mission against the Draconis Combine. These ghosts usually appear with their 'Mechs, and their thumbs-up gestures are an omen of good luck.

    <Description>In late 2825, Trondheim became the second target of the mysterious Minnesota Tribe. Because it was a prefecture capital, the 20th Rasalhague Regulars were stationed there. The ensuing battle was striking for the way the mystery 'Mechs dealt with the Kurita 'Mechs in strict Regular Army formations and tactics. Once again, the mystery group refused all attempts at communication, to the point that pilots of destroyed Tribe 'Mechs killed themselves to avoid capture. The mystery fleet then jumped from the system, apparently headed for some uninhabited star system near Trondheim.&#xD; Trondhiem is a big world scarred by several active volcanos. There are three currently errupting; two of them having been erupting for the past three years. The ash thrown into the atmosphere disrupted the planet's climate, ushering in very hot summers broken by extremely cold winters. Until the volcanoes cease erupting, the population will have to contend with the quirky weather.&#xD; The volatile nature of the planet does allow easy access to rare metals and minerals. Several major companies have been mining the planet for centuries. In addition, Amau Electronics, one of the largest electronics firms in the Draconis Combine, has its factories here. Headquartered in the city of Silvaton,  Amau makes electronics for consumer use, with products ranging from microwave ovens and music chip players to home automatic hair stylers and holo displays. Kurita consumer products have long been known for their low quality because most first-class materials are routed to the military rather than for frivolous consumer vanities. &#xD; Nevertheless, there is currently a vogue on Kurita planets to acquire electronic toys, a vogue probably fed by recent exposure to Davion and Steiner goods on occupied worlds. At the moment, this buying frenzy is beneficial to the economy. If that trend should reverse for any reason, the government is expected to denounce decadent, foreign-influenced luxuries.&#xD; The people of Trondheim seem to be as volatile as the world they inhabit. Over the centuries, there have been many protests, rebellions, and attempted revolutions. Most disturbances require the Arm of the Dragon to be put down. Currently, the people of the planet are quiet, but the ISF has not reduced its sizeable force of agents.&#xD; [3050] Trondheim fell to Clan Ghost Bear in May 3050.

With the world�s continents only making up a quarter of the total landmass, its oceans are the largest source of potable water for fifty light years surrounding Tsamma. The average rainfall is nearly seventy centimeters a year due to the high humidity and moist, tropical atmosphere. Because of the unstable atmosphere, Tsamma produces some of the most violent hurricane storms every seen.&#xD; The planet was originally named Tsunami, because of the waves generated by the storms. The spelling of the name was changed to reflect the dialect of the people. The continents of Shade, Bleacher and Arcadia produce an abundant amount of agricultural produce, including tropical fruit. Phe-Phen, the planetary capital, is the center of operations for the Tsamma-Chiquita AgroTech and Crystal Sky Water Interstellar. On the southern coast of Arcadia is the resort of Ponce de Leon, where entertainment stars from around the Inner Sphere come for leisurely fun in the sun.&#xD; [3025] Besides being a skilled unit, the Tsamma Lancers are one of the few RCTs in the AFFS to adopt uniforms and vehicle decorations that go specifically counter to the wishes of the High Command. In accordance with a Tsamma native festival sanctioned by the New Avalon Catholic Church, soldiers adorn their bodies an vehicles with flowers to show their love of peace. What was a yearly festival celebrated by the members of the Tsamma Lancers eventually became permanent.&#xD; Now Tsamma troopers are never without such flowers, whether stuck behind one ear, pinned on a jacket, or tied to their rifle. The vehicles are similarly decorated, and when real flowers are impractical, the soldiers have taken to painting bright flowers on the sides of their vehicles.

During the Succession Wars, Tsinghai slowly became the center of a planetwide industrial complex as more and more of Sarna's commercial activities were transferred there for protection.  Tsinghai has withstood numerous attacks by both Marik forces and bandits, but these have decimated the planet's once-thriving population.  Tsinghai is known today primarily for its excellent wines.  Though fallen from industrial importance, it continues to occupy a strategic location.  A regiment of Sian reserve troops is garrisoned on the planet to discourage further raiding by Marik forces. &#xD; The capital city of Tsinghai is Jingdao, however the ancient and holy city of Tienshiang, within the Kwaidong mountains, is home to the leader of the Buddhist majority on Tsinghai.&#xD; [3032] While restoring order at home and regaining control of rebel Andurien were the priorities of the FWLM, numerous hawks in Parliament who felt Janos had been too cautious in the Fourth Succession War pressured Thomas to take action against the Steiner-Davion alliance. His releasing of the newly reformed Fourth Free Worlds Guards to attack Tsinghai was intended as a sop to this parliamentary group, sating their desire for action and also the Guards� need to be bloodied in combat. Success seemed a forgone conclusion.&#xD; The FWLM hadn�t counted on Wolf�s Dragoons, however. Ensconced on Outreach, which had recently been granted them by Hanse Davion for their services in the Fourth Succession War, the mercenaries sought to rebuild their depleted coffers and fortunes. Key among their strategies was contracting out their Black Widow Battalion, commanded by Natasha Kerensky, and Tsinghai�s need for defense against Marik or Liao predation was just the kind of job they sought. It would not pay well, not even covering the Dragoons� expenses, but a victory would let the Inner Sphere know the Wolves were still around and ready for business.&#xD; In a short, brutal campaign, the Black Widows decimated the Fourth Guards, blunting their attacks and launching a series of vicious and underhanded counterattacks. In short order most of the Guards were destroyed, and the remainder, fearing the Captain-General�s wrath, fled to the Federated Suns. Over the next few years, the FWLM would come to fear the Black Widows.</Description>

    <Description>A world of mild seasons, with lush, tropical forests easily covering half of its thirteen major island-continent landmasses, Tsukude looks like a virtual paradise to the casual observer. However, the first colonists quickly realized that the planet's native splendor was more illusion than substance. The biochemistry of the local flora and fauna, which seems to draw energy more from the nitrogen-rich atmosphere than from a carbon dioxide-oxygen cycle, was found to be incompatible with human metabolism because of its dangerously high acidity. This forced the settlers to import a good deal of their basic foodstuffs and take drastic steps to develop even subsistence-level agricultural production. &#xD; Where Tsukude's farmers failed, however, those seeking to exploit the planet's hidden abundance of natural gas and mineral wealth found large amounts of both. By the time of the Star League, Tsukude had become a major local exporter of fossil fuels and precious metals, as well as home to several pharmaceutical companies. Ironically enough, Tsukude's biggest claim to fame during humanity's Golden Age was not its fuel or chemical exports, but its marine game industry. Though inedible, Tsukude's wild and exotic marine life became a favorite for trophy fishermen throughout the region, who flocked to the world every year in hopes of capturing at least one of the elusive, beautiful, and deadly Tsukude seacats. &#xD; In the wars that followed the Star League's fall, Tsukude found itself often targeted for raids by the Lyran Commonwealth or used as a staging ground for any Combine operations against the Lyrans, both of which factored into the planet's gradual decline in both tourism and industry.&#xD; Tsukude's capital, Ogawa City, is located on Ikadae, the largest of this world's northern island continents. Tomashita, a seaport city located on the western peninsula of the Soto island continent just southeast of Ikadae, boasts the largest of Tsukude's recreational fishing fleets, Green Sea Hunters. The other nine island landmasses of Tsukede, which together account for over forty percent of the planet's remaining surface, are Nakaru, Liam, and Domashimi in the northern hemisphere, and Opana, Yoshetsu, Weng-Li, Taris, Kyuna, and Shobenwa in the south. Small towns and seaports may be found on all of these continents, but by far the most populous are those on Ikadeae and Soto.</Description>

    <Description>First settled in the twenty-seventh century, Tukayyid is a relatively mild and somewhat arid planet. It is primarily an agricultural world, never deemed important enough to merit being garrisoned by a BattleMech regiment, with most of the landmasses comprised of grassy plains controlled by agrocombines. During the era of Kurita rule, several minority religions came to this world and set up monastic communities in the mountains, and in one case under the Crucible Sea. As a result the population of the world is relatively small, the government decentralized, with each corporation running its holdings like a fiefdom, except where the theocracies have carved out their little domains.&#xD; Until 3052, this backwater world was known only for its high-quality grain and spectacular scenery. Then the Clans and ComStar agreed to fight a proxy battle on Tukayyid to determine control of Terra, vaulting the sleepy planet into the pages of history.&#xD; In April of that year, fleets of merchantmen chartered by ComStar came to evacuate the world's population. In May, the largest battle in recorded history took place as over 10,000 Com Guards and Clan 'Mechs met on various fields of battle. After 21 days of fighting, an exhausted ComStar force stood victorious, having won a fifteen-year truce with the Clans.&#xD; Native farmers returned to find their lands devastated, littered with the debris of war.

    <Description>One of the most serendipitous events of space colonization occurred with the discovery that Terran cows could be bred with a similar animal native to Turin to create a breed that was both fleshier and tastier than either.  With Turin's seemingly endless plains of indigenous grasses, the planet could provide excellent pasturage for cattle.  Oddly enough, the milk of these hybrids is indigestible by humans, and so the few dairies on Turin specialize entirely in cow's and goat's milk and cheese.&#xD; Drawing on some of the few Liao stallions remaining after the Succession Wars, this world has also become famous for horse breeding, rivaling the Eridani blood lines of a century ago.&#xD; A mountain range fronting on one of the planet's oceans provides home and cover for the 212th Flying Furies jump infantry regiment.&#xD; [3032] Expecting minimal resistance in their efforts to take Turin, in April 3032, Long�s Light Lancers were surprised to find their efforts to occupy the world opposed by Kamakura�s Hussars. Settling in for a drawn-out fight, the Canopian force had fought several small engagements against the Grenadiers when news arrived of another force arriving in system: the Hussar�s sister regiment,&#xD;Ishara�s Grenadiers. Although both units were equal to the MAF unit, together they were a potent force, severely overmatching the Canopians. &#xD; With news of Drozan reaching them and seeming to confirm suspicious of a major Capellan counter-offensive, the Canopians broke contact with the Hussars and abandoned efforts to conquer Turin, withdrawing instead to Jacomarie. The&#xD;Grenadiers were not willing to let the Canopians go without a fight, however, sending a contingent of fighters to harass the Fusiliers� transports as they linked up with their JumpShips.</Description>

Because of their inherent clout as watchdogs over vital industries, larger unions tend to attract the attention of the mafia, yakuza or their local equivalents, leading to many cases where corruption in the union can grow so bad that the organization itself becomes more harmful to its members than corporate management could ever be. &#xD; In one recent case, the planetary court of Turinge sentenced the entire upper leadership of the local farm workers� union, the Turingen Agro-Ranchers� Association (TARA), to thirty years in prison apiece on charges of extortion, racketeering and embezzlement of union funds in association with the Brusikov Cartel.

Most of the planets heavy industries are based in space, primarily asteroid mining in the planet's rings, and the refining of the ore into raw materials. This leaves the planet's cities serene and free of large industrial complexes.&#xD; Edo was the capital city of Turtle Bay, prior to 3050. In May of that year, the Smoke Jaguars came and conquered the world. Hohiro Kurita, eldest son and heir to the Dragon throne, was injured and captured whilst defending the world. With the Smoke Jaguars unaware of who they had captured, Hohiro was interned in the infamous Kurushiiyama (Pain Mountain) correctional facility. The local Yakuza clan, the Ryugawa-gumi, with help from Shin Yodama, were able to rescue Hohiro, and then began a campaign of resistance against the Smoke Jaguars. After 6 weeks of rioting, and with the Smoke Jaguars unwilling to send in front line troops forces to assist their garrison forces, the city of Edo was razed from orbit. The Sawagashii river was boiled away to nothing, and all that remains of a city of over 1 million people is a charred, glassy scar on the face of the planet. Resistance across the rest of Turtle Bay ceased over night.&#xD; [3059] When the Operation Bulldog task force came to Turtle Bay in June 3059, they found the world undefended. In a gesture he hoped would in some small way atone for their loss, Precentor Martial Victor Steiner-Davion assigned the Legions of Vega to retake Turtle Bay, the unit that had lost the world to the Jaguars ten years earlier.

From the heroic stand of the Twycross Militia to the single-handed destruction of the Falcon Guards by Kai Allard-Liao in the Great Gash. During the Wolf/Falcon Refusal War, Khan Natasha Kerensky, the famed Black Widow, met her end in the single combat against Star Commander Joanna. During the Jade Falcon Incursion, the Falcon Guards were once more destroyed by the forces of General Christifori. Twycross has earned its place in history as a planet of dubious qualities. The planet has earned the nickname TodescWelt (Death's World).&#xD; The planet is a study in contrasts. Orbiting a large hot sun, Twycross has a desert climate that is as volatile as it is hot. The perpetual windstorm call "Diablo" scours the ground on the Plains of Curtains to the Carswell Barrens. Great Typhoons, tornadoes and all manner of minor disturbances are so common that the reports of major cataclysms do little more than cause Twycross natives to shrug in indifference and carry on. In order to survive, the majority of the population is housed under ground. The few surface dwellers make their homes in low squatting buildings. The capital, Camora, is built both above and below ground. The city is incorporated with its large spaceport.&#xD; With the Trellshire Heavy Industries BattleMech factory seriously damaged early in Operation Revival, Clan Jade Falcon's leaders considered the world nearly worthless, prompting Khan Marthe Pryde to cede control of the planet to Lyran forces following the second destruction of the Falcon Guards, during Operation Audacity. Not until later, did the Falcon Khans realize the depth of their mistake.&#xD; On the 8th April 3065, a force of three Diamond Shark clusters landed on Twycross, issuing a batchall to the single mixed combat command culled from Archer's Avengers. Five days of battling ensued, but in the end the Diamond sharks all but destroyed the Inner Sphere troops, taking the world for themselves. Intelligence reports indicate that the Shark's have since returned the Trellshire factories to service, but that their scout's discovered a substance not unlike HarJel which could be produced from naturally-found organic compounds.</Description>

Tybalt is wracked by tectonic activity, which has raised steep mountain ranges on all of its landmasses. Only one continent, Titania, is old and worn enough by erosion to be widely habitable. Although settlers have eked out livings as herders, trappers, and prospectors on nearly all of Tybalt's continents, its only significant population has always been located in or near MacBeth, Tybalt's capital and spaceport, which is located on Titania. &#xD; Soon after MacBeth's founding, the neighboring worlds of the Tikonov Union sent military units to subjugate the planet. With no military force of its own, Tybalt's nascent government quickly voted to join the Union in 2225. When the Tikonov Union joined the Capellan Confederation 150 years later, Tybalt was one of several Tikonov worlds that requested protectorate status from the neighboring Terran Hegemony. Eventually, Tybalt was fully integrated into the Hegemony, and the factories of Jolassa Armored Vehicles, maker of the Star League Defense Force's Fury armored command vehicle, were built. &#xD; After the fall of the First Star League, control of Tybalt reverted to the Capellan Confederation. Although its factories never suffered direct damage in the fighting, Jolassa was forced to close its doors during the First Succession War as the loss of advanced technologies made the Fury's sophisticated command computer useless. Tybalt remained part of the Confederation until the Fourth Succession War, when the Federated Suns gained control of MacBeth and drove the Capellan defenders from the planet.</Description>

Although most were small unit raids mounted merely to test Marik resolve, others targeted specific objectives such as FWLM supply depots and vital manufacturing plants. Other attacks were more involved affairs, intended by Commonwealth planners to pin down troops to allow smaller Lyran forces unimpeded access to their targets.&#xD; Defending Uhuru, the green Thirty-first Marik Militia was besieged in their own base by the Ninth Lyran Regulars and the mercenary Narhal�s Raiders. The Third and Fifth Oriente Hussars rushed to the aid of the Militia. The second half of 3014 netted the Commonwealth tons of material and tied up many Marik regiments the Captain-General desperately needed to re-deploy to deal with his rebellious brother.&#xD; [3036] Ever open for opportunities to exploit, the possibilities offered by a distracted Free Worlds prompted Archon Katrina Steiner to keep a close eye on the border despite her own difficulties in Skye and the preparations for a renewed offensive against the Draconis Combine.&#xD; Another probe by Lyran forces in August 3036 triggered a pitched battle with the Twentieth Marik Militia on Uhuru. Expecting only light resistance, the Skye forces were surprised to encounter the forward-deployed Militia. The planned objective raid turned into a three week running battle that cost each side approximately a company of �Mechs before the Steiner troops could link up with their DropShips and escape.</Description>

    <Description>Worlds boasting significant oceans, such as Ulysses in the Federated Suns, provide their inhabitants with a convenient method of transporting bulk cargos via surface vessels. While economical, this mode of transport is slow. Air transport is far faster but is also proportionally more expensive. The Terran Hegemony experimented with Wing-in-Ground-Effect craft in the twenty-fourth century, but their small Thorizer was not a successful combat vehicle. However, the WiGE�s unique qualities make it both a fast and economical option as a civilian transport. &#xD; Better known for their military aircraft designs, the Michaelson Aircraft division of Michaelson Heavy Industries has manufactured the Cormorant since 2690. One of the most common WiGEs in the Federated Suns, the Cormorant is a typical medium cargo carrier. &#xD; Traveling Ulysses� extensive oceans can be a hazardous undertaking. Large predators such as the Ulyssean Tiger Raptor give a whole new definition to the concept of �bird strike� when creatures are big enough (and aggressive enough) to seriously damage both flying aircraft and surface shipping. When confronted with eight hundred kilos of hungry reptile, the Cormorant falls back on its machine guns. &#xD; Michaelson introduced their upgraded Fulmar in 3056. Outwardly almost identical to the Cormorant, it serves as a maritime patrol vehicle and paramilitary transport. Constructed with advanced composites, the Fulmar is both faster and tougher than its civilian parent. With its extended range and higher speed, the WiGE can transport a full company of marines and their gear. Unfortunately, the Fulmar has also become a favorite with smugglers and pirates who frequent the shallow costal seas of Ulysses. &#xD; During the height of the FedCom Civil War, shipping losses reached epidemic proportions as the enterprising pirates used their WiGEs to prey on undefended vessels. This state of affairs continued until the Ulysses Navy instigated a convoy system and deployed their own Fulmars to protect the ships and locate the corsair�s base of operations. The threat was eliminated at last when a squadron of Fulmars landed a battalion of marines on top of the pirate�s headquarters on the island of Penelope.</Description>

Unfortunately, soon after they made planetfall these settlers detected a previously unidentified biological taint in the planet's air and water supplies, which rendered breathing impossible without respirators and contaminated the soil in a manner harmful to human consumption. Rather than proceed further with their colonization efforts, the original settlers moved on, eventually landing on Zebeneschamali, and relayed their findings on Unukalhai back home - or so they thought.&#xD; A second colonial expedition journeyed to this world only after all efforts to contact the original colonists had failed, but rather than deem the planet unfit, the second expedition, dominated by southeast Asian and Hawaiian pilgrims, decided to pour its efforts into terraforming their new home. Over the centuries - and with the help of a brisk trade with several surrounding systems - the Unukalhaians reclaimed an increasing region of arable land on the massive equatorial continent of Luahali.&#xD; Living in enclosed settlements, and traveling across the land in environmentally sealed vehicles, the settlers eventually worked out a native antitoxin to the Unukalhaian Taint that allowed most humans to freely breathe the air, drink the water, and eat the native foods with a minimum of ill effects. In the Star League era, this antitoxin was further refined to negate all ill effects and allow visitors and natives alike complete freedom from the nauseating effects of the planet's environment. Thanks to that development, settlement of the planet's remaining landmasses - Awalia in the north and Lukahanna in the south - exploded, with enterprising colonists eager to establish new cities and towns all over their homeworld.&#xD; In the centuries of the Succession Wars, Unukalhai was largely overlooked by invaders, primarily due to its lack of significant resources, but its proximity to Skye often made it a favored jump-off world for strikes into the Lyran realm. Thus, the cities and towns of this world were largely undamaged by the wars that followed the fall of the Star League.&#xD; Travelers coming to this planet are advised to stop first for the requisite antitoxins at the system's jump point station before making landfall at the capital city and spaceport of Wanalulu, located on the southern shores of Luahali.</Description>

Among the planet's resources is a large supply of natural alloys that the Clans find particularly useful in the manufacturing ferro-fibrous armor, and so the Bears have set up a large-scale mining operation to extract the ore.&#xD; Utrecht's rocky surface and dry plateau's make for rugged terrain. The capital city of Naragajan is located on the Labbie Plateau.&#xD; [3060] Toward the end of 3060, Khan Phelan Kell took his forth Wolf Guards to Utrecht, and challenged the Bears for the contents of one newly arrived Ghost Bear "ark ship." The prefab buildings and equipment it contained included resources for building entire factory complexes, which the Wolves (in exile) very much needed. The Ghost Bears accepted the challenge and even allowed the Wolves safcon. Star Colonel Ranna Kerensky led the main drive, while Star Captain Ragnar led a flanking maneuver that met heavy resistance from the elite Trinary command of the third bear Guard. Though the Trial was ultimately successful for the Wolves, Ragnar's Trinary fell after hard fighting, and Ragnar was claimed as bondsman by Ghost Bear Star Colonel Sarah DelVillar.</Description>

    <Description>Following the formation of the Star League, numerous soldiers were left jobless with the creation of the SLDF and subsequently went rogue. Unfortunately, the rogues had allies within the military forces assigned to Valentina. Unwilling to fight against its own, the SLDF hired the mercenary Illician Lancers to 'solve' their problem. &#xD; When the Lancers finally cornered them, the mercenaries faced not only a strong force of rebels, but also a division of SLDF troops. Outnumbered from the beginning, the Lancers' skill kept the battle from moving against them. It wasn't until a risky move by the Lancers commander, however, that the Lancers were able to turn the battle tide. &#xD; By concentrating their fire on a single spot and punching through enemy lines, the Lancers 59th Strike Regiment sped deep into the SLDF rear areas. After taking the SLDF division commander prisoner and destroying several key rebel supply dumps, they were able to capture an entire brigade. By staging from the rogue units base and using its equipment, the 59th succeeded in pushing the bulk of the SLDF division into retreat. The Lancers then crushed the rest of the rebel forces, and aided in rounding up the rogue division.&#xD; For its actions the 59th Strike Regiment earned the First Lord's Citation, the highest SLDF unit award possible.</Description>

With little chance of a major Confederation advance toward the region, the High Command cut the PDZ's training and supply budget to the absolute minimum. Over the years, skills honed by decades of opposing Capellan raids atrophies, and when the Marik-Liao offensive of '57 tore through the Sarna March, the Valexa CMM could do little more than hope the Capellan forces wouldn't cross into their region. Many officers in the unit placed blame for the invasion squarely on Archon Katherine, who refused support to the Sarna March and sundered the nation.&#xD; Leftenant General Sarah Delittle was a promising officer who got on the bad side of an AFFC Marshal and found herself "promoted" out of the Crucis Lancers and into the Valexa CMM. Surprisingly, especially to herself, she found a family in the RCT and remained with the unit even after the court-martial of her nemesis, Marshal Aldrich King. She has gone to great lengths to retrain the RCT following the '57 offensive, and her efforts have been rewarded by the Syrtis Medal of Honor and a "regular" rating for her unit.</Description>

    <Description>The one wise and constructive act of Prince Joseph Davion's entire reign was the Armistice of Van Diemen IV. In 2903, a particularly wasteful aerospace battle for the Liao mining colony of Van Diemen IV left the Capellans anxious for a temporary cease-fire with the Federated Suns. After communicating their desire to negotiate, they waited.&#xD; High government officials tried to locate Prince Joseph, who was leading an assault on the Draconis front, far from New Avalon. When they finally were able to pass on the message from the Capellans, Joseph replied that he scorned any talk of peace that did not come from the end of his gun. No matter what the government officials said about the advantages of a cease-fire, Joseph would not budge. When he would no longer listen to their arguments, several officials sought help from the Marshals of the High Command, who also agreed to talk to Prince Joseph. It was they who finally managed to persuade the Prince that a cease-fire on the Capellan front would allow him to conserve supplies for the wars against the Draconis Combine as well as giving him the image of a peacemaker in his people's eyes.&#xD; The Armistice was signed in 2905. The cease fire would remain in effect along the Capellan front for an amazing 25 years, and it laid out some rules of war that other Inner Sphere armies also unofficially adopted as time went by. The Armistice specifically forbade actions against an enemy's JumpShips, which were now a nearly irreplaceable commodity. When the Liao-Davion cease-fire finally collapsed, the unofficial ban against attacking JumpShips remained in effect throughout the Inner Sphere.</Description>

    <Description>The Orloff family�s status in the FWL�and by extension, that of their planetary landhold, Vanra�has been a source of pride for centuries. Once a part of Oriente, the provisions of Camlann v. Free Worlds allowed the Orloffs to establish their own province, which despite its small size has wielded considerable influence over the League (particularly in military circles). The maintenance of the traditions that bind this �Orloff Mafia� is inextricably linked to the pomp and circumstance that permeate life on Vanra, particularly in Orloff City. In addition to the monumental duke�s palace and regional government offices, the ornate Chapter House of the Order of the Saber dominates the city�s center, where the palace and chapter house face each other across the Padova River. Surrounded by rumors of lost technologies and secret rituals, the chapter house recently held a series of �open days� to demystify its processes. The Vanra site is one of the Order�s four key locales, with the others on Atreus, Harmony and New Olympia.&#xD; Honor-bound and emphasizing �proper� behavior, the upper echelons of Vanran society are keen practitioners of swordsmanship. Duels are common, though officially outlawed; the authorities turn a blind eye to non-lethal contests, avoiding the capital�s parks and gardens during the traditional dueling hours of dawn and dusk. Tradition likewise dictates that a doctor be present at these duels, and that seconds safeguard the life (if not the health) of the duelists. Nonetheless, accidents happen, and many nobles bear scars and other injuries as badges of courage and honor.&#xD; Hunting (mounted on horses or tabis, or else afoot) is another popular sport among the Vanran nobility. Boar hunts in the Cantania Highlands north of Orloff City and wolf coursing on the island-continent of Modena are popular fixtures in the social calendar. These blood sports also have their opponents, amid the social elite and the common people, and �hunt saboteurs� are commonplace.&#xD; Despite the behavior of its upper echelons (or perhaps because of it), Vanra�s ordinary folk are hardworking and determined. The robust and diverse planetary economy is broadly self-sufficient, though reliant on imports for many luxuries. After its military officers, Vanra�s couturiers are its best-known export, Vanran design and tailoring being synonymous with style and quality across the Free Worlds League.</Description>

    <Description>Had this world formed around a different star, experts believed that Vega VII could have been a paradise. When first discovered in the earlier days of mankind's exploration of the stars, Vega was something of a surprise, sporting vast mineral and metallic resources as well as an ocean of drinkable water, habitable temperate and polar zones, and an atmosphere that could be readily terraformed. Within fifty years after its discovery and the arrival of the first settlers - mostly from mining corporations and other industrial enterprises - Vega was a living, breathing world, albeit a warm and dry one. &#xD; By the time of the Draconis Combine's ascendance, Vega was home to a variety of light and medium industries, producing everything from personal computers to armored vehicle components and advanced medical equipment. Strict adherence to local pollution laws allowed the industries to thrive without damaging the terraforming efforts to clean up the native atmosphere, which allowed for the importing of off-world life-forms such as Terran horses and camels, favored modes of transportation among the Vegans. Because of its industrial importance, House Kurita established Vega as a regional capital world, and it served as a military base many times during various wars over the years.&#xD; Unfortunately, this distinction led to several raids by forces from the nearby Lyran Commonwealth, and even today the Vegan landscape is dotted with bombed-out cities and factories from bygone eras. Vega's single, shallow ocean, Nilos, appears from orbit as little more than a crisscrossing of extremely large rivers that divide the planet's surface into three giant landmasses. The largest continent, South Nanturo, is located completely in the southern hemisphere, while North Nanturo and Forsair share the northern hemisphere, extending into the equatorial zones.&#xD; The planetary capital city of Neucason is located on North Nanturo, and is connected by monorail line to the large industrial spaceport city of Nasew on the opposite side of the continent. Neucason is proudly regarded by many of the locals as the birthplace of the original Star League, as the site of the historic signing of the Treaty of Vega in 2569 by Hehiro Kurita, then Coordinator of the Combine, and Ian Cameron, Director-General of the Terran Hegemony. Nasew is home to Cosby Myomer Research, a myomer testing and manufacturing firm and one-time BattleMech producer known in the past for Machiavellian business practices.&#xD; Vega's biggest tourist attraction by far, even over the site of the Treaty of Vega signing, is the so-called Pyramids of New Egypt, located on the rocky, arid plains of Forsair. Built during the Star League era, the five pyramids were the whim of an eccentric megabillionaire, who believed in the pantheistic religion of Terra's ancient Egyptian civilization; the pyramids were built as a sign of his devotion. Since then, there have been many attempts to burrow into or under the pyramids in search of treasure, but nothing has ever been found. The Pyramids remain the biggest draw for off-worlders and treasure seekers on Vega. Over the centuries, the influx of tourists became so heavy that a commercial port city dubbed New Egypt has indeed grown around the Pyramids.</Description>

The General did not have enough DropShip or JumpShip assets to transport his entire command from Velhas to Sirdar in one move, however. He mobilized two brigades, leaving behind two infantry and one armored regiment, anchored by his third 'Mech battalion, to guard the world alongside the local militia.&#xD; The Forth Guards left the Velhas system on the 4th April, while the local militia was still mobilizing itself. Two days later, a task force consisting of the First Federated Suns Armored Cavalry and the Ninth Illician Lancers entered the system, intent on hitting the Forth Donegal before it could mobilize in support of other Loyalist activities in the war.&#xD; General Rudolph Chapman, commanding the Armored Cavalry, realized the Guards had probably already left the system when his ships failed to detect their JumpShips, but he hit the world anyway, quickly boxing the demi-brigade within their positions in Corvas and C�diz and hitting separated units with wave after wave of 'Mech and battle armor assets. The planetary militia, commanded by former AFFC Hauptmann General Robert Casswell, opted out of the fight, pledging their neutrality. Corvas fell on the 13th, while C�diz fell a mere day later.&#xD; Having received a message from Field Marshal Sortek indicating the Forth Donegal was likely heading for Sirdar, Chapman left the world just as quickly as he had hit it, leaving behind a Ziliang infantry regiment to reinforce the Velhas militia.</Description>

After the fall of the League, Mountain Wolf continued to produce Night Hawks well into the Succession Wars, though the decay of technology reduced their performance to a mere shadow of their original design specs, until the Vendrell factory was destroyed by Marik forces in 2945.&#xD; In 3055, Brandon O'Leary, great-grandson of Eli O'Leary, Mountain Wolf's last President and CEO, invested much of the family estate and drew on a host of corporate and government contacts to reopen the Lyran plant at Monte Lupus, following his success in restoring the company's Alpheratz plant more than four decades earlier. Reintroducing the company�s signature 'Mech has gone a long way toward boosting Mountain Wolf as a major military producer, but despite brisk sales in the wake of the FedCom Civil War and sales of their heavier Merlin to Periphery interests, the company remains in precarious financial shape.</Description>

    <Description>Fifty years ago, the silver-furred walrus of Verde was all but extinct. Prior to man�s colonization, the world�s coastal waters were teeming with this mammal; its almost-iridescent pelt shone as they sunned themselves on shore, while their incredible constitution allowed them to dive deeply and quickly hunt the sea creatures they consumed. Over the centuries the animal was hunted nearly to extinction, however � especially during the Succession Wars, when the world�s residents were forced to hunt the creature to survive. Each walrus provided a great deal of meat, which was a popular delicacy on the interstellar market, as well as other useful products. Locals could turn its hide into clothing that fetched incredible prices, refine its blubber into a heating fuel, and use its tusks and bones in a variety of arts and crafts.&#xD; Thanks to over-hunting, the silver-furred walrus was placed on the Federated Suns� Protected Species List in 3021 � nearly crushing Verde�s industry in the process. For the next two decades, natural means were used to help the walrus population increase in size, including breeding it on other worlds, but it wasn�t until the secrets of the Helm Star League Memory Core were unlocked that the silver-furred walrus was truly saved.&#xD; Melcher Meat Animals, Ltd., headquartered on the nearby world of Melcher, used secrets of genetic engineering and laboratory reproduction to rapidly increase the walrus herds on Verde. Additionally, the company began to breed the animal on three other worlds across the Federated Suns. Within fifteen years, the company was selling silver-furred walrus meat, pelts, and ivory in limited quantities on the interstellar market. Ten years later, these products can be found easier, though still at a premium price. Walruses harvested from the wild on Verde are still considered the best, but the rapidly growing walrus ranches are for now the only ready source � and proof positive of MMA�s internal axiom: �Extinction is no danger if the flavor is good.�</Description>

    <Description>Norn II, a world better known as Verthandi, is a planet poor in natural resources, but rich in culture, art and history. It�s populations long tradition of freethinking independence has brought it trouble when full-scale revolt broke out in mid-3023. A seemingly unexceptional world of small villages set among blue-green hills, the world was shaped thousands of years ago by a collision with an asteroid that struck near Verthandi�s north pole. The impact area created the vast north polar valley now known as the Silvan Depression. Marked by numerous small, shallow, and interconnected seas, the Silvan Depression is heavily forested. In some places, water and forest mingle to form virtually impenetrable swamps.&#xD; The lowland forest is encircled by the Rimwall, the heavily eroded remnants of the ancient impact crater. Beyond the Rimwall lies a grassy veldt stretching for hundreds of kilometers, and blending gradually into desert. Most of the planet is desert, in fact, and Verthandi is officially classified as a desert planet. The majority of the population lives in the Silvan forest along the landlocked seas, and on the surrounding grassy plateau beyond the Rimwall.&#xD; Numerous lumber and coffee plantations are situated in the broad and fertile Silvan Basin, with quiet resort communities lying along the tropical coast of land-locked Azure Sea. Some heavy industry is centered near the principal cities, as well petroleum and various metal ores deposits. Chromite, principally, and bauxite, are dug or pumped from the edge of the deserts to the south.&#xD; The capital of Regis is governed by Verthandi's ruling council of Academicians, a democratic body elected from among the senior professors of government at Regis University.&#xD; [3050] Clan Wolf landed on Verthandi in May 3050. Defending the world were the Kell Hounds Second Battalion (Second Kell Hounds), Third Battalion (Second Drak�ns), and the Forth Verthandi Armored Infantry Brigade. The Hounds and the Drak�ns hoped to gather information about the Clans by setting up a network of remote cameras and other recording devices on Prince William Island, a small forested island. When challenged by Star Colonel Athen Kederk of the 328th, the defenders requested that Prince William Island be the battlefield. Clan Wolf agreed, impressed by their opponents' ability to honor the batchall.&#xD; The fighting was fierce as the defenders repaid the enemy almost blow for blow. After five hours of fighting, the Hounds and the Drak�ns ordered a retreat, but not before a Star of Elementals broke through the defensive lines and destroyed most of the recording equipment. The Hounds fled to the Federated Commonwealth and the Drak�ns jumped to Rasalhague.</Description>

After Lieutenant Koharken's execution for treason on New Year's Eve, 2899, House Liao made certain no military coup would ever occur again on Vestallas.  This planet is also remarkable for the evolution of a unique architectural style, distinguished by gracefully curved walls and gently curved and sloping floors.

    <Description>[3036] The First and Second Oriente Hussars invested Villanueva in the second week of May 3036, as part of the FWL�s campaign to re-conqueror the rogue Andurien province. Recently rebuilt after the disastrous battle on Wallacia, the Second Hussars saw this action as their blooding and were keen to engage the enemy, though Colonel Calderon Benge knew his force was subordinate to the more experienced First Hussars. Employing the regiment�s fast medium �Mechs, he sated both desires with a series of lightning raids on garrison positions that provided valuable intelligence. &#xD; Whereas the Second had been rapiers, leaving a host of small wounds on their opponents, the First were a sledgehammer. Their three reinforced battalions quickly overwhelmed the opposition, crushing everything in their path. Only one engagement threatened the First when two battalions of Andurien armor tried to overrun the Hussars� Beta Battalion. Expecting a substantially less numerous foe, the militia were horrified by the Hussars� return fire and quickly withdrew; the First lost three �Mechs, while the militia lost fifteen tanks. Within two weeks, the campaign was over and Villanueva judged pacified.</Description>

    <Description>Orbiting a yellow giant that is prone to all manner of solar activity, from massive sunspots to occasional gravitational shifts intense enough to set off earthquakes and volcanoes, Vindemiatrix is a world facing its own eventual extinction. Scientists believe the final collapse of the parent star is still millions of years away, but already the effects of its death throes have been felt on this world. In the centuries since the first settlers came here, over fifteen percent of the varies species in the local flora and fauna have become extinct, with another thirty percent formally listed as endangered due to gradual changes in climate and the added stress of human occupation. &#xD; Though numerous initiatives to slow the decline of the ecosystem have been attempted through the centuries, none have been entirely successful. Despite this gloomy forecast, Vindemiatrix remains a pleasant enough world to visit and live on. Several veins of common metals, suitable to support a modest industrial base, are backed up by enough arable land to support the planet's population. The planet is also home to the Vindemiatrix Observatory, a university focused almost exclusively on the study of planetology and stellar phenomena. &#xD;Understandably, the largest focus of study at the Observatory campus is that of stellar life cycles, with the planet's own star serving as a point of reference. Vindemiatrix Observatory is located on the outskirts of Havannask, a mining town on the northern continent of Treshiria. The planetary capital, Brattleston Depot, and its attendant spaceport, are located on the southeastern continent of Scandavara. Vindemiatrix's third large landmass, the southwestern continent of Kressia, is home to most of the planet's ranching and farming communities, thanks to its abundance of arable land, and also boasts the largest natural wildlife preserves for the planet's endangered species.</Description>

Once a simple map-making service devoted to the needs of the career trader, Virtue Cartographers today encroaches on ComStar's area of expertise with its own small fleet of converted military freight vessels, refitted for duty as the company's own explorer corps. The ships were a purchase made possible by a grant from the late Archon Katrina Steiner in the mid-3030s, but it has taken the company close to twenty years to obtain a large enough fleet and enough qualified crews to undertake the lofty mission of deep space exploration outlined by then-CEO Louis Comrada. &#xD; The recent openness from ComStar after the Schism with the Word of Blake also allowed the rest of the Inner Sphere � including Virtue Cartographers � access to the more detailed maps maintained by the quasi-religious order. Now armed with new data, Pedro Comrada has modified his father's mission somewhat, and plans to use the VirCart fleet to explore the Deep Periphery for trade routes and worlds yet undiscovered.</Description>

In particular, Vixen is now the site of the most elite series of winter sports, with the ten-mile cross-country ski and bobsledding competitions chief among the main contests. Of particular interest to offworlders is the emergence off all-girl hockey teams, whose reputation for gamesmanship and brawling have attracted thousands of visitors to this backwater planet in recent years. &#xD; An additional draw is the opportunity for hunting native mammalian lifeforms that inhabit the largely untouched wilderness forest of Vixen's southern continent. Because of Vixen's purely recreational character, there are no military units of any type present on the planet. For defense, the planet relies on its distance from major trade routes to discourage the occasional marauding band.&#xD; [3067] Though initially the pet project of the Magistrix, the Raventhir Cuirassiers have languished in the boondocks of the Magistracy. Stuck on the border, and denied access to upgraded technology, the Raventhir regiment's morale remains low. Regardless, both regiments have had their hands full with a drastic increase in pirate activity over the past several years.&#xD; The Second Raventhirs have sustained significant casualties in the past nine months, during incessant raids stretching from Vixen to Crawford's Delight.

    <Description>Vosloorus is a member of the Regulan Free States, three breakaway Principality of Regulus planets that won their independence in 2681. Born from Captain-General Gerald Marik's war against the Selajes that he believed killed his family, this small federation bought its loyalty to the Mariks and hastily installed a pro-Marik government. The Free States soon discovered, however, that freedom on paper was worth little against constant meddling in their politics and economy by their former parent province. Not until Thomas Marik passed the Addendum to the Incorporation in 3037 did the Regulan Free States finally gain the power to chart their own course.&#xD; Since then, local cultures and planetary economies have undergone a vibrant renaissance. No longer strangled by Principality trade embargoes, Free State industry and exports are thriving. The Mongol and Kazhak languages, outlawed in the early days of secessionist rumblings and then rendered virtually irrelevant by Principality dominance of local life, have made a striking comeback to become the primary languages in this tiny province. Norwegian is also widely spoken on Olafsvik, site of a sizeable Norwegian enclave since the earliest days of human settlement.&#xD; Vosloorus is governed by a feudal autocracy.</Description>

Using their intimate knowledge of the city, the police led the second Jaegers into ambushes, then disengaged from battle and escaped through the city's storm-drain and sewer systems. &#xD; The Jaegers destroyed the central precinct house and captured or killed most of the police force. To their credit, the police crippled an OmniMech and killed four Elementals before the fighting ended.&#xD; [3051] With the resumed Clan invasion in 3051, ilKhan Ulric Kerensky ordered Clan Jade Falcon to relinquish this world to Clan Steel Viper for that Clan to use as a base of operations. The Triasch Keshik formally accepted the planet from the occupying Jade Falcon force. In addition to being the Vipers' first possession in the Inner Sphere, the world of Waldorff is the site of a major logistics depot and a massive munitions plant that supplies the Viper Touman. Knowing how much the Jade Falcons covet the plant, the Viper Khans have made sure that Waldorff is well protected, assigning the Tenth Fang to guard the factories and warehouse complexes.

    <Description>[3033] The end of the Forth Succession War left Wallacia and Kujari located between the militaristic and newly independent Duchy of Andurien and the Capellan confederation. When the Internal Emergency Act of 3030 stripped away league member worlds of their sovereignty, Wallacia and Kujari formed a mutual defense pact and declared their independence from the Free Worlds League in 3032. &#xD; On Wallacia, the declaration was an empty one. The Second Oriente Hussars garrisoned the world and moved quickly to seize the capital of Saranak, shutting down the parliament and trying to arrest as many members as possible. The rebellious leaders set up a government in-exile on Kujari, under Acting Prime Minister Shandra Tate. As internal conflicts prevented the League from pressing the attack against Kujari, Tate entered in negotiations to hire the recently formed Black Widows Battalion to restore sovereignty on Wallacia and to protect them from the Confederation.&#xD; A brilliant hit-and-run campaign by the Widows slowly whittled down the Hussars, and with the League absorbed in internal conflicts, no reinforcements were forthcoming. The Widows then united into a single force and, along with Wallacian irregulars and a scattering of armored vehicles, moved against the capital to retake the parliament. The Hussars, spread thinly across the continent, had only left a company to hold the city, and were soon overwhelmed.&#xD; Prime Minister Tate succeeded in making a broadcast to the people, declaring Wallacia liberated, and calling upon the demoralized Hussars to surrender. The offer to the Hussars included immediate parole, and the promise not to confiscate their 'Mechs if their surrendered. Faced with a military disaster and a suddenly hostile populace, the Hussars had little choice. A cease-fire was established within hours, and after several days of negotiations, Hussar commander Colonel Arthur Rivernider agreed to Tate's conditions. By New Year's Day, 3033, Wallacia was once more independent.&#xD; As Tate and Kerensky had anticipated, Wallacia rejoined the Free Worlds after the rebellious Anduriens were brought to heel and the Hussars returned. But the superior military position obtained by the Black Widows enabled Shandra Tate to wring considerable concessions from the League negotiators.</Description>

The company barely escaped ambush by the military forces, and for the next three months dodged enemy patrols and aerospace fighters.

One of several companies stripped from supporters of Anton Marik after his brief rebellion, Ronin is little more than an assembly facility for designs developed elsewhere. The simmering industrial disputes on Wallis have so far limited the company�s ability to compete in the wider market, resulting in little innovation, though its production capacity has increased substantially over the past two decades.

In summer 2584, Star League High Command General Amos Forlough was recalled from his operations against the Outworlds Alliance to restore control. &#xD; General Forlough was given a veritable carte blanche on men and material to resume offensive operations. Using striker regiments raised and trained by his predecessor, he began a scorched-earth policy. His first target was the world of Warren.&#xD; Forlough first blockaded the target system and demanded an unconditional surrender of all Taurian forces within 30 days. When the allotted time elapsed, the General's strikers had total freedom, not only to destroy the determined Taurian defenders, but to also render useless any and all sources of economic and military potential. While bands of Star League Marauders and Warhammers ravaged the countryside, destroying crops, food stores, and munitions depots, Forlough's navy warded off repeated attempts by the Taurian fleet to break through the blockade. &#xD; Warren fell to the Star League in September 2584.</Description>

    <Description>The planet Wei started as an agricultural world, supplying worlds around it with the necessities of life. It was also an important source of ores and minerals  including iron, gold, copper and titanium. What it became was a repository for nerve gas agents for the Star League and then the Capellan Confederation. Certain plants were discovered to produce chemical compounds that, when combined, produced deadly nerve agents. &#xD; Wei has one very large continent, Province, which covers almost 33 percent of the planet's surface. It is centered in the equatorial region and extends from the northern hemisphere southeast to the southern hemisphere. It is in the southern reaches of Province that the poison-producing plants are grown. The planetary capital, Vandannis City, is located in Vandannis Valley, a very large valley in the center of the continent.&#xD; Here the infamous Wei gas (its military designation: UrbStryc-A) was manufactured in a secret base located at Bonganville. Wei gas was designed to kill immediately and for easy cleanup. During the Fourth Succession War, Davion forces found out about this gas the hard way. Even those secure in their tanks or BattleMechs found that the gas trapped in air filters would evaporate due to the heat, then release itself as minute particles into the air circulation system. In the end, Wei gas cost the invaders two full battalions of troops. During the Capellan-St. Ives war Wei gas was used by Thuggee Cult terrorists, this time in major population centers of St. Ives, including the capital city, Milos, and Indicass. Thousands died as a result of the gas.</Description>

    <Description>During a Davion raid on the planet Weisau, a large unit of Goblins became cut off by enemy forces. Just as the infantry were ready to disembark, the Goblin commander saw the last Davion �Mech lance destroyed by enemy assault �Mechs. The whole unit then made a hasty but prudent retreat into the surrounding hills. This situation put the Goblin unit into a difficult situation.&#xD; Realizing that they were cut off from supplies on a hostile planet and with no news of a DropShip coming to pick them up, the commander and the subcommanders of the Goblin and infantry units devised a plan. They hoped to transmit their location to friendly troops still in the system, or at least to wreak enough havoc among the enemy to significantly influence the outcome of any future raid on Weisau.&#xD; The Goblin commander sent out his infantry on a raiding and reconnaissance mission. Their primary assignment was to find food and equipment stores and then to report the location of these back to the Goblin unit�s temporary headquarters in the hills. The infantry�s secondary mission was to raid any small towns and villages they encountered. Their tertiary objective was to hit any �Mech and vehicle repair stations found, though only with the utmost caution.&#xD; Within a week, the infantry had discovered three small villages and a �Mech service outpost. The outpost was to be the first target. The Davion commander held back the infantry as more useful for a later fight, and sent the Goblins in to attack the outpost. They managed to destroy it before the outpost troops could relay a message to their own commanders.&#xD; The infantry attacked the first village under cover of night. The village was only lightly defended and certainly not prepared for a sneak attack. After only a few minutes, the infantry captured a long-range communications station. The commander decided to use this station after the other villages were under his control.&#xD; The second and third villages fell just as quickly as the first. The last village was somewhat more prepared than the first two, however, and so the fighting lasted longer. The village defenders never really had a chance, however, against the combined forces of the infantry platoons supported by the Goblin�s lasers.&#xD; After the last village fell, the Goblin commander used his captured comm gear to contact any DropShips that had been in the system, even though he had no real hope of contacting friendly ships. It turned out that DropShips had been sent to look for them. After receiving the SOS, the DropShips arrived to pick up the unit a day later.</Description>

    <Description>The genesis of the festival, known alternately as the Festival of Giving and as the Feast of Bounty, is lost to history. What is known is that it grew to significance on a group of Outback worlds, from Molino to Weldon, during the Reunification War and expanded out from there. Equal parts religious and secular, this festival is very popular within the Outback and on major agrarian worlds, and it celebrates the annual harvest (or whichever of a world�s multiple harvests is typically the most bountiful). Of course, as every world has a different seasonal cycle, this particular festival is celebrated at varying times throughout the Federated Suns. &#xD; In fact, there are several interstellar concerns, the largest of which is owned and operated by the Green Star Corporation, that specialize in traveling from world to world to organize and run these celebrations. Every world observes slightly different customs in their celebration of the Festival of Giving or the Feast of Bounty, but in general the festival lasts from three to five days and includes the showing of animals, massive feasts, music, dancing, and sometimes a carnival.</Description>

Talon is far more, however, than anyone would imagine: Kallon Weapons Industries' home is here. Despite Talon's lack of natural food sources, Kallon felt the planet's excellent rare metal deposits justified them building on the mountainous world. Wernke in fact supplies the food and water needs of Talon.&#xD; Kallon has been producing Star League era quality 'Mechs since it went online during the Star League's glory days. No one knows how or why Kallon's plants were still producing units of that quality, even during the three centuries of succession wars. So far, Talon's security has not been breached, protected by layers of corporate, AFFS and DMI security. &#xD; Wernke is an important agricultural world in the New Syrtis PDZ. Both Talon and Wernke have vested interests in one another. Kallon Industries supplies Wernke's agricultural industry with all the Agro, Forestry and Construction 'Mechs while Wernke supplies all of Talon�s water and food needs.&#xD; Three of Wernke's four continents, Jal, Crimeia and Vesper, produce all the agricultural products of the planet. The small island continent of Tonkya is a mountainous island cloaked in secrecy. Very few people outside Kallon Industries and the government know what is gong on there. DropShips are seen landing at night and leaving during the day. The mountains hide all activities and the airspace is restricted.

    <Description>[3067] Free Worlds Defense Industries formed in 2562 in response to the shifting economic climate in the League. The merger of Gibson Federated BattleMechs and Andurien Aerotech formed a corporation of sufficient size to compete against large multinationals such as Kallon and Earthwerks, as well as powerful national companies like Irian Technologies. Despite this, only government involvement in the labor disputes that wracked the company in the 27th century allowed it to survive near-bankruptcy and limp on to the financial goldmine of the rearmament that followed the repeal of First Lord�s Edict 2659. The counterstrikes of the First and Second Succession Wars exacted a terrible toll from FWDI, whose Lopez facility was razed by Liao forces and only rebuilt with grants from the Andurien government. &#xD; The company�s ties to the Humphreys clan placed the board in a difficult position during the crises of the 3030s � FWDI found itself an unwilling partner in the secession attempt, the Andurien Aerospace plant forcibly incorporated into the duchy�s war efforts while Marik forces occupied the Gibson facility. Only in 3041 did the board regain control of its sites, instituting a decade-long program to rebuild and upgrade the shattered complexes. The cost of reconstruction pushed the company to the brink of bankruptcy again, but once more its fortunes shifted with the renewal of war � this time the Clan invasion and massive export orders from the AFFC and the DCMS. &#xD; Andurien, Lopez, and the Ennis plant on Westover are home to the principal Andurien AeroTech factories, responsible for building advanced models for domestic use and cut-down export models that often use low-quality generic components. A halo of subsidiary companies and contractors supports the main aerospace plants and their workers, providing everything from airframe components and electronics to catering services and uniforms. �Mech-armed corporate security troops guard each facility but each plant also has close links with federal military forces charged with their defense. &#xD; The �Mech plant on Gibson escaped the ravages of the Andurien War, but recent years have seen it co-opted by the Word of Blake into building up forces for the Blakist military. Only since the occupation of Terra by Blakist forces and the shift of production to former Hegemony sites has FWDI regained full control over its factories. Initial hopes that the years of Blakist domination over the Gibson complex would result in a cutting-edge facility proved unfounded�almost all of the advanced systems installed by Word of Blake engineers were stripped out, and only a handful of systems predate the occupation of Gibson.</Description>

    <Description>Early records concerning the Valdis system are fragmentary. It is believed that independent asteroid miners first began exploitation of the Valdis belts prior to the 24th century. Certainly, there was a permanently manned facility on the large asteroid known locally as Rikerstrike by 2403, and a consortium of Terran-based deep-space exploration and development corporations had begun construction of a Zenith point recharging station by 2450.&#xD; The Valdis System consists of two major bodies, plus multiple asteroid belts. The inner world is officially Valdis I, but generally known simply as "Rock", is a barren, airless and waterless world, where temperatures vary between 150�C in the afternoon to -50�C at night.&#xD; Valdis II, known locally as "Giant" or, humorously, "The Hard Place", is a superjovian gas giant with a diameter some five times that of Sol V (Jupiter). Valdis II is credited by planetologists with the current form of the Valdis. It's massive gravitational field disrupted early planetary formation, a disruption which prevented the creation of man-habitable worlds but left the Valdis belts instead.&#xD; The Valdis belts are the source of most of the system's riches. Iron and nickel are the principle products, or course, but large quantities of chromium, cobalt, magnesium, gold, platinum, iridium, silver, tin, tungsten, and copper are also mined here. Rikerstrike, the largest of the Valdean Beltworlds, is located in the Mid-Belt and is still the site of the system's principal settlement outside of Wheel itself. Other important resource points in the system are the Giant's moons and rings, which are the principal sources of water for the various human settlements.&#xD; The principal center of human activity in the Valdis system is, paradoxically, nowhere near the various worldlets and asteroids in the system's planetary plane, but at the star's Zenith jump point. Wheel began as a system recharge station, but because of the inhospitality of the various worlds of the system, and due to the relative abundance of local raw materials, the Zenith station grew to become the principal habitation center for the system, providing homes, recreation, and services for the miners and corporate executives assigned there.&#xD; The Valdis system has been fought over many times in the past, though two major considerations remain true. Firstly, Wheel itself is literally irreplaceable, so many of its construction techniques have been lost during the centuries. Major damage to the station-keeping drives, or the massive fusion drive that powers them, would result in disaster as Wheel slowly - but inexorably - fell into the systems sun. A second consideration is the presence of a Class B ComStar HPG on Wheel. No would-be raiders or defenders wish to instigate a battle which could damage or destroy the station - with the attendant threat of ComStar imposing punitive measures on the combatants.&#xD; As a result, Wheel itself has achieved something of a neutral status. Free traders and merchant ships have called freely at Wheel for many years. Under the shelter of a general unwritten and unspoken agreement, even Lyran Commonwealth nationals have visited Wheel freely and conducted their business there - usually trading agreements with Kuritan merchant firms - although Steiner warships know better than to test this de facto neutrality. Because of this, Wheel has become a pot similar to, if not as active as, Lyran Port Moseby. Like Port Moseby, Wheel provides both an avenue for Kuritan merchants who seek goods beyond the borders of the Combine and an outlet for those of their own products which interest visiting Lyran traders. Local Kuritan government representative seek, with varying levels of success, to limit the exposure of their own nationals with "foreigners" to encounters with high-ranking officers and trade representatives.&#xD; Other targets within the Valdis system are fair game, however. Numerous raids have been staged against titanium storage yards on the surface of Valdis I by Dropships making high-G runs from the Valdean Nadir jumppoint.&#xD; [3051] The soldiers of Epsilon Galaxy's Dorbeng Garrison Cluster dealt easily with the defenders of Wheel, in December 3051. The Free Wheelers, a corporate regiment composed of two companies of light 'Mechs) and the First Wheel Mechanized Militia were not inept by any means. In fact, they were actually better trained than most other second-line troops. The two units simply failed to act in a coordinated fashion, even when defending the same line.</Description>

    <Description>The high temperatures and high atmospheric pressures at sea level prompted many of the early settlers who came to Wing to establish their cities and colonies on the planet's rocky mountains and high plateaus. Many of these colonists also found these locales somewhat easier for maintaining steady communications with the mining outposts built on all four of the world's moons, all of which are heavily laced with valuable ores, including titanium, bauxite, and even germanium. &#xD; It was the moons of Wing that truly drew the crowds to this world, rather than the inhabitability of the planet below, but the discovery of a world capable of supporting life was seen as a definite plus to the corporations that funded the first expeditions here. This resource-rich system was quickly incorporated into the Free Worlds League before the expanding Federation of Skye could stake a claim here, but with the rise of the Terran Hegemony and the Free Worlds' admission into the original Star League, this world became a joint holding between Houses Marik and Cameron. Wing's industry made it a border trading post and relay station for Hegemony and Free Worlds traffic alike. &#xD; After the fall of the Star League, Wing reverted to complete Free Worlds authority, only to be captured by House Steiner's Lyran Commonwealth during an early offensive. The Free Worlds League reclaimed Wing in 2917, but in the centuries of the Succession Wars, constant raids and the changing of hands eventually took their toll on this planet. By the mid-thirty-first century, over half the planet's Star League-era settlements and mining outposts on all four moons were lost forever, decimating the planetary economy and seriously impairing off-world trade. &#xD; The planetary capital of Wing, Crow's Nest, is located on the southern continent of Sharr. Crow's Nest also includes a large spaceport, but not the planet's largest one. That honor goes to Port Wyvern, the massive DropShip landing and servicing complex on the south polar continent of Greinwald, around which the city of Wyvern has grown.</Description>

    <Description>For more than two hundred years the Twenty-Third Marik Militia was locked in a feud with the Third Republican (formerly Justine's Grenadiers), a unit of the Capellan Reserves. The enmity between the two units stems from the battle of Wisconsin in 2838, when the Capellan troops decimated the Eight Marik Militia through treachery. Taking advantage of the League's dispute with ComStar (later called the ComStar War) and the ensuing communications interdict, the Capellan Confederation launched a series of attacks into the League's interior. &#xD; The Eighth militia met the Grenadiers in battle near the planetary capital of Madison but were betrayed by traitors within the unit. When Liao saboteurs poisoned the regiment's water supply, the Eighth offered little resistance. Less than a quarter of the soldiers survived the torture and atrocities that followed. Absorbed into the Twenty-Third Militia upon their return home, the survivors of the Eighth soon convinced their new colleagues that revenge should be the unit's primary goal.&#xD; Ever since the Wisconsin tragedy, the Twenty-Third Militia has taken every opportunity to slight the Grenadiers, transferring its enmity to the Third Republican when it absorbed the Grenadiers upon the units, and the Tikonov Free Republic's, creation in 3029. When a League task force destroyed the Third Republican, now a FedCom unit, during Operation Guerrero's liberation of Van Diemen in 3057, the Twenty-Third felt mixed emotions. Though pleased that their long-hated enemy had been destroyed, many of them also felt they had lost their purpose with the end of the long dispute.</Description>

    <Description>When Woodbine was settled in the late 23rd century, colonists never dreamed their planet would become the agricultural center it has become. So important is Woodbine that all the farm worlds in the Kilbourne and Milligan PDZs ship their produce to Woodbine for distribution throughout the Draconis March. Additionally, Woodbine produces its own not-insignificant agricultural output, which supplies Robinson with a major portion of its agricultural needs.&#xD; Woodbine�s continents, Reindl, Mansdor and Zebulon, have devised a crop rotation plan that allows farms on one continent to remain idle during the massive growing season, while replenishing the nutrients leached out by the crops grown in the previous season. The remaining farmlands are still more than able to meet production demands, and in that way there is enough left after harvest time that they can store up for winter.&#xD; Though Gastogne is Woodbine�s planetary capital, it is not the industrial center. Rhinehold, founded by the ruling family, is the heart of Woodbine�s industrial might. At the heart of Rhinehold is a kilometer-wide industrial park, dividing the city into two sections connected by thin commercial centers around the outside. A large, lightly wooded park with a manmade lake set among grassy banks, puts much-needed space between the heavy industrial sections and the administrative and residential areas of the city. What is not as well known is that Sutel has built a weapons production plant for their energy weapons research just outside of Rhinehold.</Description>

    <Description>Refugees from the North American continent on Terra originally colonized Woodstock during the latter half of the 22nd century. Woodstock was very similar to Terra, though its sun was different; the planet was a perfect place to start a new life. &#xD; Woodstock is a temperate world devoted to raising agricultural products and a variety of livestock. The continents cover 27 percent of the planet. The three oceans are as rich and vibrant with life as the land is fertile. York, the largest continent, produces most of the beef and grows some tobacco for cigars. Recital City is the planetary capital and is located on Sjardijin, the smallest of the three continents.&#xD; It was on Sjardijin that the Terran Hegemony and then the original Star League set up an agricultural research station that looked at ways to more efficiently produce crops to feed the many worlds in the former Hegemony. It was rumored that Star League scientists discovered a new method that would advance the science of pest control. This was confirmed during the Fourth Succession War when Federated Suns units liberated Woodstock.&#xD; Woodstock's third continent is Essex. It is the only blemish on this beautiful world. During Amaris' occupation of the Hegemony worlds, Woodstock was attacked by elements from the 141st Amaris Dragoons. They launched a preemptive strike on Woodstock, using chemical and nuclear weapons to target the military base located on Essex. The SLDF garrison was obliterated. The weapons poisoned Essex, rendering the continent all but uninhabitable. The continent is now used in studying radiation's effect on the environment.</Description>

    <Description>Xanthe III has several times been colonized as a mining world. The first attempt, by Atlan Ltd in 2752, mined for ice to sell to water poor worlds. The discovery of the naturally occurring 'blue ice' (water with cobalt or cupric salts in suspended solution) which comprises close to one third of the planets surface ruined the water miners. Blue ice is poisonous. The second company, Freez Inc, intentionally mined blue ice for the ice vests than preceded coolant vests. Blue ice takes two to four times as long to freeze as pure water, but it takes correspondingly long to thaw. Hence one pack can be used longer. Cost of transport caused Freez Inc to fail. Magna Metals and its successor companies have had the longest tenure on Xanthe III. A small but viable manufacturing colony has succeeded there, basing its economy on the manufacture of semiconductors for various purposes.&#xD; Some concern has been expressed by environmentalists as to the unstable maintenance of oxygen in the planetary atmosphere when few offworld plants have been successfully introduced in any but a hydroponic setting. The colony is self-sustaining by means of hydroponics and protein vats.&#xD; The small northern archipelago contains the least stable terrain in the sea of ice that is the planet. Terrain within 5km of the ice-rock is the ice-rock interface is the most dangerous in the planet. Normal ice and blue ice are subject to the tidal pull of the planets three moons. In a slow-motion version of oceanic waves, the substances turn and recirculate. Resulting dangers are frequent ice quakes, and a changing treacherous terrain. Maps of a month before, far less a season before are useless. Crevasses, sinkholes, and caverns form and change. Under a coating of ice may lie needle sharp ice spines or inter-linking crevasses a hundred kilometers in length. Fierce winds erode them, only to have ice quakes thrust up and break apart into new dangers.&#xD; An interesting feature of the buildings is their lustrous sapphire hues. The usual method of construction is to erect a temporary inflated structure, emplace water and power conduits along it, and then spray with liquefied blue ice. Once this has hardened on both sides of the structure, an extremely dense and durable structure is created, with a higher tensile strength than steel.&#xD; [3037] During the Andurien War, the assault on Xanthe III was led personally by Captain-General Duncan Marik. The initial landings went well, but the Captain-General underestimated the enemy's strength in his rush to secure a victory. Consequently, the assault soon bogged sown and Duncan found himself on the defensive. In a final bid to break the Third Defenders of Andurien, he led his ill-prepared troops in a desperate assault against the Andurien positions and died at the head of his troops on 4 February 3037.</Description>

    <Description>Xhosa VII is a world of barren plains, interrupted by mountain chains and thick forests. It is rich in deposits of metals and chemical energy resources. The planet's population has tended to cluster about the five main spaceports, leaving the rest of the planet only sparsely inhabited by loggers, hunters, and farmers. The capital city is named New Xhosa.&#xD; [3039] Kanrei Kurita himself led the Operation Orochi assault on Xhosa VII - the Draconis Combine�s feigned counter-invasion of the Federated Suns during the War of 3039 - taking the Ryuken-go across the Combine/FedSuns border in late July and hitting Xhosa VII on 3 August. He didn�t have the entire Ryuken-go with him, however; one battalion continued on to Clovis while the third battalion remained on their JumpShip, ready to instantly respond to wherever it was needed. &#xD; The Kanrei struck hard, initially grounding just outside of Ginti and taking control of the warehouses there. Kurita hit the veritable jackpot; normally home to the Davion Light Guards, Ginti had but a relatively small garrison and still housed a great deal of materiel and supplies for the Light Guards. The Ryuken suffered heavy casualties, but they made off with almost more booty than they could carry, allowing them to operate for months more.&#xD; The Kanrei spent most of the rest of the month on the world, striking target after target. He eventually brought in the final Ryuken battalion, making the world�s defenders believe a second regiment had come in to finish the job, so to speak. The two Ryuken battalions worked in concert and individually, further confusing Xhosa�s militia, but primarily targeted the bases and facilities normally occupied by the Light Guards.&#xD; On 26 August, the Kanrei left the world and made his way to Exeter while the third Ryuken battalion continued their own raids on the world. Surprisingly, it wouldn�t be until early November that the AFFS would finally send any significant forces to oppose the Ryuken (a �free� regiment of conventional armor landed in early September, but half the regiment fell prey to a surprise coordinated Ryuken air and ground strike). Marshal Winston Vaskursian, having led the Seventh Crucis Lancers and Second New Ivaarsen Chasseurs away from New Mendham, grounded and deployed his significant forces to counter the reported two enemy BattleMech regiments on the planet. &#xD; His aerial reconnaissance soon told him that his enemy was barely battalion-strength, however, and he immediately sent as much as he could against them as quickly as he could. Less than an hour of battle was all that was required to send the Ryuken packing; they lifted off under heavy fire, losing one DropShip and more than a company of �Mechs. The Ryuken did manage to get away with thousands of tons of supplies, though, tempering the victory. The Ryuken battalion returned to the Combine heroes, their job done well.</Description>

As a result, it is little more than a place for the bureaucracy to work and the site of a major rest and recuperation base for the Arm of the Dragon.  The regiment stationed on the planet is the 15th Benjamin Regulars, but the planet often plays host to battalions from other units as they rotate off the front lines for rest and resupply.  A whole slew of industries have sprung up around the comings and goings of the soldiers.  Xinyang has a large supply depot and one of the largest and best equipped military hospitals in the Draconis Combine.  It also has a major ISF facility, which debriefs any soldier coming off the front lines, in search of new information about the enemy.  It goes without saying that the ukiyos in Xinyang are large and well staffed with men and women of pleasure for the soldier's enjoyment.  As the planet cannot support the food needs of its large population, the spaceports are busy with incoming shipments of food from surrounding worlds.</Description>

    <Description>The colonists who settled Yance I - dubbed Agador by its inhabitants - were anti-technologists, mostly of Amish descent, who sought to create a world free of the ravages of widespread industrialization and commercialization. Putting aside their beliefs long enough to plan, finance and undertake a relocation from one world to another, these settlers came to Yance I, assured that they would find a new land to their liking. Yance I was a terrestrial world of diverse climates, with open, hilly bands of fertile soils in the temperate zones, a mix of jungles and deserts in the equatorial zones, and frozen tundra and glaciers in the polar reaches. However, what went unnoticed in the first planetary surveys was the dominant animal life form. &#xD; No sooner had the settlers made planetfall and founded their first colonies than their imported livestock - and even a few of the colonists - began to succumb to attacks by a predator called the black reaper. This aggressive, feline-like mammal, similar in many ways to the Terran puma, but almost half again as large and with a large, spiked, prehensile tail, roamed the plains of the primary continent of Paradiesland. The settlers at first tried to wall in their lands to keep out the reapers, but the powerful beasts broke through or leapt over their wooden constructs, causing massive damage. Relocation also failed to work, as the reapers, attracted to the new food source, simply followed them. In desperation, the mostly pacifistic colonists resorted to primitive firearms, only to find the reapers' hides resistant to such weapons. &#xD; The colonists were forced to turn to modern technology to control the animals, bargaining with traders from nearby worlds for heavier weapons, including automatic rifles and laser weapons. These concessions to advanced technology saved the colonists but eventually eroded the pilgrims' way of life. Over the following centuries, Yance I's population gradually became more modernized, a transition that caused no small degree of conflict between the orthodox and progressive populations and led to the relocation of the traditionalist settlers to the neighboring continent of Neuhoffen. The ascendance of the Terran Hegemony and its incorporation of Yance I led to the further industrialization of Paradiesland, including the establishment of a small arms factory for SLDF infantry weapons.&#xD; Meanwhile, Neuhoffen became a haven for those seeking escape from the evils of modern life, virtually left alone while the rest of the world entered the Golden Age of technology. The years under Combine rule saw even more turmoil for Neuhoffen residents, forced into increasingly smaller enclaves by the Kuritan rulers, who saw a better use for the minerals in the mountains of the continent. &#xD; Today, the orthodox Amish and Mennonite communities that remain on Neuhoffen have become little more than tourist attractions, a nostalgic look back at where humanity once was. The capital city of Yance I is Firstpoint, located on the western coast of Paradiesland. Endstehen, the largest of the remaining "old world" settlements on Neuhoffen, is set on that continent's southern reaches. Yance I's other three continents - Alameda in the northern hemisphere and Brisbane and Ausdaner in the south - make up the rest of the planet's landmass. Of these, only Ausdaner, completely covered by the planet's southern ice cap, is uninhabited.</Description>

    <Description>Settlers from the ancient Terran state of China named the planet Yangtze after the Yangtze River of their homeland. Like the Yangtze floodplain on Terra, Yangtze's landmasses are flat and covered in a thick layer of fertile soil fed by seasonal flooding from the planet's many slow-moving rivers. Fearful of the destruction wrought by these inland floods, Yangtze's initial settlers huddled in small fishing villages and towns on the rocky coasts of the planet's two small continents, Han and Sung. &#xD; Realizing that the planet's agricultural wealth could be unlocked if its massive floods were controlled, the Capellan Confederation invited the Terran Hegemony to jointly administer Yangtze during the First Star League. Hegemony engineers erected thousands of miles of dams and dikes, turning Yangtze's two muddy continents into prime cropland and raising Yangtze's population tenfold. With the fall of the First Star League, Yangtze reverted to Capellan control.&#xD; During the Second Succession War, rogue mercenaries destroyed the flood controls on the continent of Sung, resulting in massive destruction and loss of life. Although Yangtze's agricultural output was halved, the continent of Han continued to be productive, and Yangtze remained one of the Capellan Confederation's primary agricultural exporters. The Federated Suns took Yangtze in a relatively bloodless action during the Fourth Succession War.</Description>

    <Description>A warm world covered almost entirely in shallow, blue-green oceans, Yed Posterior would be a strikingly beautiful planet were it not for the chronic storms that ravage the northern Yeddi Island Chain, a series of twelve small landmasses that collectively account for all of the planet's inhabitable surface area. Because of these storms, the early colonists established several submerged outposts offshore, taking advantage of the shallow depth of the oceans in an effort to escape the worst of the driving winds and pounding rains that routinely lashed their surface settlements. However, several of these underwater habitats eventually succumbed to the same natural forces that also plagued the offshore mining rigs set up to exploit the planet's mineral wealth before refined construction methods developed during the Star League era led to sturdier habitat and rig designs.&#xD; As a border world, Yed Posterior saw its fair share of raids and invasions during the Succession Wars as Houses Steiner and Kurita clashed over control of the Skye and Tamar regions. These raids inevitably decimated the mining interests on-planet, despite the efforts of the local marine militia and their fleet of submarines and hydrofoils. The worst battle to take place on this world, however, erupted in 3063, during the FedCom Civil War, when a Lyran intelligence failure led to a massive firefight between the Fifth Lyran Regulars and the combined might of the Fourth Davion Guards and the Seventh FedCom RCT. This action actually pushed the Davion units - previously neutral - into Victor Steiner-Davion's camp. The damage caused by this battle ravaged most of the cities on the largest of the Yeddi Islands, including the planetary capital of Epoch.</Description>

The shintoists have turned a deaf ear, but the Duke is equally stubborn in refusing to look for an alternate construction site.&#xD; Walther Jensen, President of the Yed Prior government, has stepped in on the side of the Shinto priests and their large forest of Yed conifers. This so enraged the Duke that he ordered elements of the planetary garrison to seize the disputed land by force. President Jensen retaliated by having the police force of the nearby city of Kezma enter the forest and dig in. The commander of the planetary garrison, Leutnant-Colonel Greston Patterson, wisely decided that the Duke's orders were an illegal use of Commonwealth weaponry. He countermanded the marching orders and confined the garrison to its bases.&#xD; At the time of this writing, the private forces of Duke Keskula have surrounded the forest and its defenders in an attempt to starve them out. Riots in support of the forest defenders have broken out in many cities. An envoy from the Steiner government has arrived to attempt mediation.

    <Description>A large world of large oceans, diverse wildlife, and a few veins of mineral resources, the biggest obstacles to the colonization of Yorii were the planet's stronger-than-average gravity, its native, territorial wildlife, and the fact that its soils did not support the majority of Terran food crops. &#xD; None of these factors proved insurmountable to the early colonists, however, who simply learned to adapt and established thriving industrial and mining communities on three of Yorii's four island-continents. Heavy-metal deposits, some very deep below the planetary surface, and most accessible to off-shore drilling platforms, provided the basis of the planetary economy, while the few hybrid food crops that could be grown became the staples of the planet's mostly Asian population.&#xD; On the continent of Yokohama, where the dominant native life-form, the Yoriian tiger-raptor, was most populous, the colonists built high walls around their settlements and farmlands, and began a hunting initiative that brought the bold reptilian predators under control within a decade. In the days of the Star League, Yorii's capital city, Neo-Tokyo, set on the shore of the planet's largest continent, Shokaku, was a haven for commercial trade between the Draconis Combine and the Terran Hegemony, and a healthy portion of the city's population claimed dual citizenship in both realms. &#xD; During the Amaris crisis, the Usurper's troops used many of Yorii's larger cities and industrial complexes as battlefields when the SLDF came to liberate the planet, which ravaged the planet's economy and infrastructure, rendering millions homeless and millions more dead. Neo-Tokyo was left totally uninhabitable when the last of Amaris' holdouts deliberately sabotaged the fusion reactor that powered the city in an effort to distract the League troops while they made an escape attempt.&#xD; The Draconis Combine easily assimilated Yorii after the fall of the League, establishing the planet as a forward base for raids against the Lyran Commonwealth, Capellan Confederation, and Federated Suns. Despite numerous punitive raids and the ravages of the Succession Wars, Yorii gradually managed to reclaim some of its former prosperity.&#xD; Each of the four populated continents - Shokaku in the south, Yokohama to its northeast, Khesan and Xu-Lai in the north - now support a handful of major cities, with the new capital city of Shenobi on Yokohama.</Description>

    <Description>Though it lacks significant natural resources or major industries, and the locals appear to concern themselves with little more than fishing and moisture farming, Zaniah is a world that has forever gone into the annals of history for being the host world of the St. Marinus House. Long overlooked through the ages, St. Marinus, founded in the early days of the Succession Wars, is one of only a handful of such sanctuaries throughout the Inner Sphere - a retreat for MechWarriors, weary of fighting and eager to devote the remainder of their lives to spiritual discovery. &#xD; Located deep within one of Zaniah's many desert regions - the locals never reveal where, for the benefit of those who seek such solitude - St. Marinus is said to be surrounded by kilometers of trackless canyons and long-dead lava flows. Amazingly enough, St. Marinus is known to favor no affiliation, whether Great House or mercenary, and throughout its centuries of operation, many warriors from the Inner Sphere, Periphery, and even the Clans, have been known to retire forever from the horrors of war at this retreat. &#xD; Though some of history's most prominent figures - such as Morgan Kell and Peter Steiner-Davion - have resumed their lives of warfare after supposedly retiring to this hallowed sanctuary, the vast majority of MechWarriors who have come to Zaniah have never returned to the firing lines.&#xD; The sanctity of St. Marinus is well respected. So much so, in fact, that in the centuries since its founding and despite the ferocity of the Succession Wars, even mercenary raiders have taken pains to avoid locating and attacking this site, focusing their energies instead on the more populous regions in and around the planetary capital of Starboro.&#xD; Zaniah is mostly land, its surface water divided mostly among its four major seas - Beowulf and Lambard in the northern hemisphere, Vaclav and Wendall in the southern. Rivers, reservoirs, and artificial channels have made the coastlines of these seas quite arable for many kilometers inland, where water purifiers render it safe for drinking and bathing, but Zaniah nevertheless relies to some degree on imported water to supplement its people's basic needs. In exchange, this world exports basic machinery, including commercial vehicles and private aircraft, though the bulk of the heavy industries supporting this trade are limited to the region surrounding Starboro (south of the Lambard Sea). &#xD; Interestingly enough, Starboro does not boast a major spaceport, but Hartzborg, an otherwise unremarkable metropolis near the Wendall Sea, features enough facilities to support modest DropShip traffic. Some have taken the presence of the spaceport there as a sign that St. Marinus indeed lies close by, a theory supported by the thriving tourist trade in Hartzborg, built around the historical significance of the monastery, but little other evidence exists to support these theories.</Description>

    <Description>Zavijava is an extremely volcanic world, so much so that high quantities of sulfur gas and other particulate matter blown into the atmosphere by constant eruptions have rendered the air difficult to breathe without filter masks, and prompted an ongoing exodus from the planet. The eruptions began rather suddenly in the twenty-fifth century, long after the first settlers made planetfall on this otherwise unremarkable but heretofore terrestrial world. &#xD; Since then, the rate of eruptions has risen steadily through the years, to the point where no less than seven active volcanic chains spew lava and ash on a weekly basis. The cause for Zavijava's geological woes has never been adequately explained, and even stymied the Terran Hegemony's experts during the Star League era, but the effects have been dramatic indeed. In almost six hundred years, the worldwide environment changed so radically that most of the native animal species have gone extinct and temperatures worldwide have dropped nearly ten degrees due to the "nuclear winter" effects of so much ash blown into the sky.&#xD; The planetary population, once numbering almost three billion, has also dropped steadily as the disturbances continue, but enough hearty souls and mining corporations have remained behind to try to make the most of the situation. Adding to the declining state of this world, of course, has been its history during the Succession Wars. As a Lyran-Free Worlds border planet, Zavijava has naturally been the target of countless raids and military campaigns in the centuries since the fall of the Star League.&#xD; Zavijava has two major continents - Peniah in the north and Velvel in the south. The planetary capital, Tzion, and Zavijava's main spaceport are located on Velvel.</Description>

    <Description>With its snarled network of canals and waterways, Zaniz City is the largest on Zdice, covering well over two hundred square kilometers with a population of only ten million. A thriving taxi service sprang up among the myriad of narrow water routes that snaked through the metroplex. The Ina-du (�snake� in ancient Cherokee) was introduced with little fanfare by Hoyle Systems in 2870 and quickly became a favorite among the couriers and taxi drivers, thanks to its high acceleration rate, efficient fuel cells, and durable frame. &#xD; Over the subsequent decades, Hoyle made few modifications to the three-man skimmer, with the hoverskirt design overhaul in 2997 the only notable exception. With the precision electronic sensors tied to the primary rear steering vanes, the Ina-du automatically adjusts small sections of the airskirt to allow for greater maneuverability. This modification was well-received among the water taxi unions, as it allowed drivers to wind through the city�s waterways with an appreciable gain in speed, getting customers to destinations faster.&#xD; Competition between the three major taxi unions was inevitable. After the DeWalt Group suffered three fatal �accidents� in one day, the union leaders met to discuss the escalating violence. Though little was resolved in their initial conference, the seeds of what would become the Extraordinaire Canal Contest (ECC) were planted. Because the competition for fares was intense � leading to over four hundred accidents and incidents during 2999 alone � something was needed to alleviate the problem. The brainchild of Jonas Silt, the ECC was born as a way for the taxi companies to compete in a biennial competition. The overall winner would be able to determine their own exclusive zones (within some limits) for the next two years and command a higher base fare. &#xD; Initially, the Zaniz City council was against the idea. Somehow, conducting a highspeed hovercraft racing circuit over the course of three days that could endanger life and property didn�t seem to appeal to them. With reservation, they allowed the first ECC to occur in 3001 and were shocked when over 300,000 people turned out to watch various taxi companies compete on a complex water course that miraculously resulted in no deaths � even after a Trosbarty Taxi missed a hairpin turn and vaulted through the local Hecc�s department store on the canal�s edge.&#xD; Recognizing an instant cash cow and an obvious boost to tourism, the city council unanimously endorsed the ECC for an indefinite period of time. Every odd-numbered year, the ECC Racing Board reveals the new eighty kilometer course for the coming year�s contest. Strict regulatory rules dictate that the taxi companies participating must use existing motor pool assets, leading to many custom variations and body styles among the drivers. Not surprisingly, Hoyle started a customizing line for their Ina-du model, continuing to keep a lock on the skimmer market. Flashy and affordable, citizens and visitors to Zaniz City are treated almost daily to a variety of paint schemes, body art, and chrome piping. With the rising interest in the Ina-du�s versatile build, Hoyle recently began sponsoring the Zdice Custom Expo, drawing over half a million visitors to the 3066 Expo to view the latest accessories and custom show skimmers.</Description>

    <Description>Though it orbits farther out than any other body in its system, Zebebelgenubi is a warm planet dominated by mountains that often completely surround several orphaned seas and lakes. The interior lands of all five major continents are mostly rugged wastes of rock, broken only by the occasional river that has stubbornly cut its way through over eons of history. Many of these mountain ranges are covered by petrified woodlands, fossilized remains of a long-lost era when water flowed more freely across the planet's surface. Only in the coastal areas is there sufficient flatland on which to build, and it is in these regions that the bulk of the planetary population has lived since the planet was first settled in the twenty-third century. &#xD; But, despite its rugged frontier appearance, Zebebelgenubi soon became home to a booming electronics and robotics industry, thanks to the discovery of precious gems and industrial-grade silicon in the mountains. These industries only grew more lucrative when Zebebelgenubi became part of the Terran Hegemony and Ulsop Robotics, headquartered in the planetary capital of Gray Valley City, became the prime developer for artificially intelligent space defense system networks. Ulsop's SDS networks became the Star League standard, protecting every valuable system in the Hegemony with a combination of fast, artificially intelligent drones, orbital defense satellites, and even surface-to-orbit weapon batteries. &#xD; Unfortunately, this crowning achievement of Zebebelgenubian engineering also led to the world's downfall when Stefan Amaris, the Usurper, staged his coup and his troops swept down all over the Hegemony. After forcing the scientists to teach them the secrets of the SDS networks, Amaris's troops executed all of them and attempted to destroy all of Ulsop's facilities, ravaging many of the planet's major cities in the process. Centuries of Succession Wars did the rest, demolishing the remnants of Zebebelgenubi's once-mighty industrial and technological base. Though rumors persisted of caches of lostech left behind in hidden mountain facilities, none materialized that could save the planet from a long, slow decline. &#xD; Today, Gray Valley City remains the largest and most industrialized of Zebebelgenubi's cities, but it is the city of Nantucket, on the nearby Wurscht continent, that boasts the planet's largest spaceport - half a kilometer longer than Gray Valley's, to accommodate more aerodyne DropShip traffic. All three of Zebebelgenubi's other continents - Hershaim in the north, Valius and Zeibleria in the south - are sparsely populated, with the majority of towns and smaller settlements located on the shorelines.</Description>

    <Description>A cold world orbiting a dim red star, Zebeneschamali was initially settled by colonists from Terra's Middle Eastern region, who wanted nothing more than to establish a life far away from the corrupting influence of their homeworld. Though the climate of their new home was not the same as the warm, arid region from which they came, and though the planet lacked significant raw material resources beyond basic industrial metals and common chemicals, the new settlers took to their new home and established several small towns along the banks of the rivers on Kirikahmed, the planet's primary continent. Within a few decades, the colonial population swelled and new settlements rose across the plains and rugged landscape of Kirikahmed's northern reaches, and bolder adventurers turned eager eyes to the untapped expanse of the North and South Arragon continents. &#xD; However, upon making survey flights over the western coast of North Arragon, the native Zebeneschamalis were shocked to discover the presence of other human settlements, apparently recently established. Originating from a failed expedition to Unukalhai, these new colonists had come to this promising world after failing to establish their own, believing Zebeneschamali to be uninhabited when they landed. The discovery and immediate reaction led to a string of violent clashes as each colonial group declared the other an invading force, but this fighting eventually died down when leaders on both sides reached an agreement on their mutual expansion.&#xD; Not long afterward, Zebeneschamali became a part of the Federation of Skye, and eventually the Lyran Commonwealth, and remained under the Lyran banner throughout the age of the Star League and the Succession Wars that followed.&#xD; Today, a trace of Zebeneschamali's founding decades can still be seen in the slightly different cultural and religious mores of the North Arragon and Kirikahmed populations, as well as in the presence of two capital cities - one for each continent. The Kirikahmed capital and primary spaceport, which is also regarded as the primary planetary administrative center, is Ur-Kabal, while the North Arragon capital city, Jakrit, touts itself as the planet's second largest population center and spaceport city.</Description>

    <Description>An otherwise unremarkable world, Ziliang gained prominence during the last decades of the Third Succession War. For centuries it had been an isolated interior Capellan Confederation world; mining and mineral extraction was this harsh world�s only significant industry. Its inhabitants were largely uneducated (except for the political prisoners sent there to work and die in the mines) and poor. Those that weren�t working in the mines or imprisoned in one of the several prisons and �re-education facilities� came to escape the rampant Capellan oppression on the more prominent and prosperous worlds. On Ziliang, they could disappear into the difficult wilds.&#xD; During the latter half of the Third Succession War, the AFFS made slow advances into the Confederation on two axes aimed directly at Sian: one through the St. Ives Commonality and the other cutting through the Sian Commonality, the final pushes of which ultimately liberated Ziliang. At first, New Avalon considered it just another backwater world, but as the push through St. Ives faltered, the AFFS High Command saw Ziliang as the perfect position for a forward operating base from which to launch deep raids into the Confederation. Since then it has been the permanent home of the premier raiding force in the AFFS � the First FedSuns Armored Cavalry.&#xD; Life on Ziliang today is better than it was under Capellan rule, though in many cases not by much. The mining industry has been largely automated, significantly increasing the output of raw materials while similarly decreasing accidental injuries and deaths. The prisons are still open, though they now house the worst criminals in the Capellan March, and the reeducation facilities now serve other functions. Education is still a problem, however, as are many other social issues; were it not for the AFFS facilities, which provide advanced medical care and other services for those who need it most, Ziliang would be on par with some of the worst of the Outback worlds.</Description>

    <Description>Having escaped from the clutches of the loathed Capellan Confederation, Zion�s people found the prospect of a dynastic marriage between the Marik and Liao families too much to bear. In the mid-3050s, the world of Zion and its attendant province erupted in a violent rebellion, put down by the FWLM in a bloody campaign.&#xD; The collapse of the marriage deal and its attendant alliance in the early 3060s came as a bitter irony, considering the many scars of the abortive revolt that remain in settlements across this planet. The arid expanse of the Negbek Desert suffered the most when the pipeline that supplied its outlying settlements with fresh water from Lake Aleppo was sundered in several places. For the duration of the revolt, local farmsteads and communities were forced to rely on small water-extraction and desalination plants; only after the FWLM occupation were engineers able to patch the pipeline system.&#xD; A military occupation force remains on Zion, under the command of G�n� Ward, but the general takes a hands-off approach to commercial affairs and the economy has made a surprising recovery. Trade with the Federated Suns is brisk, as is that with the independent worlds of the former Sarna March. Even Capellan merchants journey to trade in Zion�s bazaars, but for the most part they maintain a low profile and keep to their own enclaves in the capital, Beersheba. Only the seemingly endless series of terrorist attacks by radicals has prevented the return of civil government, the need to neutralize the scattered cells taking precedence over the return of civil liberties. For the most part, the population does not object to this continuing �soft occupation,� regarding the handful of troublemakers in their midst as a threat to their own lives. Most locals see the terrorists� actions as opportunistic rather than linked to Zion�s own anti-Capellan agenda.</Description>

In the course of their survey, the team discovered major oil and coal deposits in the planets various mountain ranges. Since then, more than 30 corporations have bought land for new industries on Zolfo. The Duchess of Zolfo has already begun to use some of the profits from the land sales to build the planet's first schools and collages. Zolfo is no longer one of the Skid Row worlds, and promises to vindicate Prince Davion's economic development policies by becoming the core of a whole new sphere of economic growth.&#xD; [3049] The so-called �Great Stock Market Fire� on Zolfo occurred in 3049, where the whole financial district burned down due to the crash of a petroleum-carrying Mule DropShip. While the initial impact was bad enough in itself, it was the ensuing dense cloud of blackest smoke, combined with sudden shear winds from the heat and subsequent explosions that made a deployment of firefighting VTOLs impossible.

    <Description>Zollikofen, sometimes nicknamed "treasure planet," is perhaps one of the great oddities of the Inner Sphere. Like many of the better colonies discovered early on in mankind's exodus into space, Zollikofen was blessed with an abundant water supply, fertile soil, and a thriving ecosystem that could easily support a fledgling colony. In addition, the world also boasted as many rich veins of precious metals such as gold, platinum, and silver, as it did common ores like iron and copper. &#xD; Indeed, such valuable minerals proved so common to Zollikofen miners that the planet's economy was soon based on uranium and germanium deposits, as they were the rarer native metals, and a thriving export industry quickly rose based on handcrafted items of pure gold and silver. The Terran Hegemony managed to stake a claim in Zollikofen before the Lyrans could, keeping this remarkable find in the hands of the House of Cameron for many years under the Star League. This factor also contributed to the establishment of a Star League mint, which produced Lyran currency in Trader's City, one of the larger metropolii on the planet's single supercontinent of Besitzland, as well as the SLDF's Lyran Command headquarters.&#xD; Miraculously enough, during the Amaris Crisis, the Usurper's troops did not harm the mint in Trader's City, though they did loot many of the press works and spaceport warehouses nearby. Indeed, the mercenaries hired by Amaris to secure this world focused almost exclusively on eliminating the Lyran Command forces instead, and securing several of the larger mines in a much more professional - if still undeniably greedy - strategy.&#xD; After the fall of the League, Zollikofen came into Lyran hands, but the Star League mint was destroyed soon after, during the outbreak of the First Succession War, when House Kurita troops sacked the planet and resorted to nuclear and orbital bombardment to shatter Lyran resistance. For this reason, more than the gradual depletion of the gold and silver mines over the centuries, much of Zollikofen's wealth and prestige has tarnished since those glory days.&#xD; Today, in fact, much of the planet's wealth now lies more in industrial metals such as titanium, vanadium, and bauxite, than in precious metals drawn from contaminated or dried-up mines elsewhere. Despite this, the world of Zollikofen still occasionally experiences the odd "gold rush" when new veins are uncovered, but after nearly a millennium of mining and radiation poisoning, most of the really good veins have long since been tapped out or rendered useless. &#xD; The capital of Zollikofen today is the city of Fulbright, located on the banks of the Platin River. This megalopolis of over two million residents is also home to the planet's primary spaceport and the corporate headquarters of three major local mining concerns - Gershwin Mining Collective, Dahler Valley Resources, and Rosamund Minerals, Unlimited.</Description>

    <Description>Zosma's star is a blazing-hot, white, A-class sun twice the size of Terra's Sol, which whips its few rocky planets around at breakneck speed and occasionally pulses in size due to its own inherent gravitational instability. For this reason, astronomers long assumed it impossible for any planets - let alone life-bearing worlds - to ever form around it. The discovery of four planets - one a fairly dry, thin-aired world marginally capable of supporting human life - thus sent understandable shockwaves through the interstellar community. &#xD; Though quite inhospitable, with its rocky terrain, brutal, year-round heat, and nutrient-poor soil that supported only a few limited species of native flora, intrepid colonists actually established settlements on Zosma. Forced to live in sealed habitats, shielded from the solar radiation, with limited protection against the odd planet-wide quakes that erupt when the parent star undergoes another brief contraction, the people of Zosma found it next to impossible to produce enough food. They have relied heavily on ice ships and off-world produce, trading the abundant metallurgical resources mined from the planet's interior in order to survive.&#xD; Because of their harsh existence, severe laws were eventually imposed to regulate resources and control population growth among the Zosmans, particularly after the fall of the Terran Alliance, and the local government quickly evolved into a military dictatorship. As part of the Free Worlds League's Border Protectorate, which stood on constant alert against Lyran attacks throughout the Succession Wars, the military government focused the planetary energies primarily on defense, and responded swiftly to internal dissent as a sign of potential treachery.&#xD; This reign of terror continued until Zosma was captured and absorbed into the Federated Commonwealth in the Fourth Succession War. Though efforts were made to loosen local restrictions and boost the ravaged planetary economy under Commonwealth rule, most of these efforts produced only minor improvements, and lasted only until House Marik reclaimed the world in 3057.&#xD; Visitors to Zosma can expect heavy security and restrictions, which remain in effect to control and sustain the planet's scarce basic resources and ensure planetary balance. The capital city of Duhr Prime, located on the shores of Scalding Sea, the larger of Zosma's two micro-oceans, is the only point of entry legal to off-worlders, though a second suborbital transit hub exists in Fort Amadeus, near the Shallow Sea in the southern hemisphere.</Description>
